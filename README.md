## Awesome LLM-based Agent â€” Live Catalog

**Live catalog:** [https://saifs-aihub.github.io/RoadMap2-LLM-Agents/](https://saifs-aihub.github.io/RoadMap2-LLM-Agents/)

A lightweight, continuously-updated catalog of research papers on LLM-based autonomous agents. The site aggregates recent work (aiming for daily refresh) and provides a clean reading experience with search, filtering, category navigation, and quick detail views.

### What this project is
- **Dynamic agent paper browser**: Explore recent agent papers with fast keyword search and simple filters.
- **At-a-glance insights**: Each analyzed paper includes a short summary, key insights, pros/cons, labels, and publication metadata.
- **Practical navigation**: Switch between list and detail views, jump using the mini-TOC, and sort by relevance, recency, or a composite score.
- **Regularly updated**: Designed to ingest new papers on a frequent cadence (daily-targeted).

### Categories and labels
The category and label schema (e.g., Profile Definition, Memory Mechanism, Planning Capability, Action Execution, Agent Collaboration, Applications, Benchmarks and Datasets, Tools, Security, Ethics, Survey) draws inspiration from recent surveys on LLM-based agents, including:
- Wang et al., [A survey on large language model based autonomous agents](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11704-024-40231-1) (Frontiers of Computer Science, 2024)
- [A survey on LLM-based multi-agent systems: workflow, infrastructure, and challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21460) (arXiv:2503.21460)

### Audience
Researchers, engineers, and students tracking the rapid progress of LLM-based agents will find this catalog useful for quick discovery and lightweight triage before deeper reading.

### Notes
- This repository focuses on explaining what the catalog is and why it exists. It intentionally avoids code-level details here.
- The web UI is optimized for readability and quick comparison across many papers.
- Citation counts displayed in the catalog are sourced via the [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api).
