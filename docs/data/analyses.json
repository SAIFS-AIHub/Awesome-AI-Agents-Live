This paper introduces Foam-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate intelligent CFD simulations. Foam-Agent employs an Architect, Input Writer, Runner, and Reviewer Agent, supported by three key innovations: a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system for context-specific knowledge, a dependency-aware file generation process ensuring consistency across configuration files, and an iterative error correction mechanism for autonomous diagnosis and resolution of simulation failures. Evaluated on 110 diverse OpenFOAM cases, Foam-Agent achieved an 83.6% executable success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, substantially outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (55.5%) and OpenFOAMGPT-Alt (37.3%).

To address this, the authors conduct the first systematic evaluation of MAS execution traces using Grounded Theory, analyzing over 200 conversation traces from 7 diverse open-source MAS frameworks. This rigorous analysis, involving six expert human annotators, led to the identification of 14 distinct failure modes, clustered into three categories (Specification Issues, Inter-Agent Misalignment, Task Verification), forming the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST).

Case studies demonstrate that interventions guided by MAST, such as improved role specifications and architectural changes, can yield significant performance improvements (e.g., +15.6% for ChatDev).

The primary objective is to guide a group of agents to a specific target formation, which is a linear transformation of a pre-defined nominal configuration, even allowing dimensions higher than the agents' coordinates. The proposed LFC architecture allows formations to dynamically adjust through arbitrary linear transformations, enhancing adaptability to various environments. Key contributions include the concept of \"linear localizability\" to ensure leaders uniquely determine the target formation, and a linear formation control method utilizing a pre-defined stress matrix. Furthermore, for scenarios where the stress matrix is unavailable, the paper designs distributed estimators and proposes an estimation-driven LFC method based on the graph Laplacian matrix.

This paper introduces MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to address this gap by evaluating LLM-based multi-agent systems across six diverse interactive scenarios, including collaborative coding, research tasks, Minecraft building, database error analysis, and competitive games like Werewolf and Bargaining. Alongside the benchmark, the paper proposes MARBLE (Multi-agent cooRdination Backbone with LLM Engine), a flexible framework supporting various communication topologies (star, tree, graph, chain) and reasoning strategies (e.g., cognitive self-evolving planning). Novel evaluation metrics are introduced, encompassing milestone-based Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), structured planning and communication scores, and a dedicated competition score, validated by human evaluation. Experimental results reveal that while intrinsic model capabilities are crucial, coordination plays a complex role, sometimes failing to compensate for execution deficiencies. Graph-based coordination and cognitive self-evolving planning demonstrate superior performance. The study also highlights emergent social behaviors, such as strategic information disclosure and role-driven collaboration, providing insights towards AGI-level collaboration.

    "summary": "The paper investigates a debate-based framework as a scalable oversight mechanism for aligning advanced LLMs, particularly when models surpass human expertise and ground-truth labels become scarce. Inspired by Irving et al. (2018), the approach involves \"weaker\" non-expert judges evaluating arguments from \"stronger\" expert debaters in an information-asymmetric reading comprehension task, augmented with a quote verification tool. Comparing debate to a consultancy baseline using both human and LLM judges, the study demonstrates that debate significantly improves judge accuracy (88% for human, 76% for LLM judges) over naive baselines and consultancy. A key finding is that optimizing debaters for persuasiveness—an unsupervised metric based on judge approval—enhances their ability to argue for the correct answer, thereby increasing judge accuracy. Human judges also exhibit better calibration and lower error rates with debate. Conversely, increased persuasiveness in the consultancy protocol leads to a degradation of judge accuracy, as consultants can become more adept at advocating incorrect answers. The work highlights debate's robustness and promise for eliciting truthful answers in settings where judges lack privileged information.",

This paper introduces meta-prompting, a novel task-agnostic scaffolding technique designed to enhance LM performance and robustness.

    "summary": "This paper introduces AgentCoord, a visual exploration framework designed to simplify the creation of coordination strategies for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, addressing challenges like natural language ambiguity and cognitive overload from text-heavy interfaces. AgentCoord proposes a structured representation for coordination strategies—comprising Plan Outline, Agent Assignment, and Task Process—which serves as a foundational scaffolding. Leveraging LLMs' capabilities, it generates an initial strategy from a user's general goal through a three-stage process. The framework visually organizes this strategy using elements like bipartite graphs for task dependencies and agent cards, significantly enhancing comprehension. It also supports interactive, multi-thread exploration of alternative strategies for each stage with LLM assistance, for example, using heatmaps to visualize LLM's prior knowledge for agent assignments. Finally, AgentCoord provides visually enhanced execution results with explicit linkages to the strategy design, aiding efficient analysis and debugging. A formal user study with 12 participants demonstrated AgentCoord's effectiveness, showing improved comprehension, facilitated design, and better result analysis compared to baseline text-based systems, thus enabling broader general users to design complex agent coordination strategies.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently suffer from factual hallucinations and reasoning errors due to the uncurated nature of their training data. Existing methods to improve accuracy typically focus on single model instances. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent debate approach where multiple LLM instances (agents) collaboratively refine answers. Given a query, agents first generate individual candidate responses. Then, over several rounds, each agent reads and critiques the responses of all others, using this feedback to update its own answer. This iterative process encourages the models to construct answers consistent with internal and external critiques, often converging on a single, more accurate consensus. The debate method significantly outperforms single-model baselines, such as zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and reflection, across six diverse reasoning and factuality tasks, including arithmetic, grade school math, chess, and a new benchmark for computer scientist biographies. Key findings show that both the number of agents and debate rounds are crucial for optimal performance, and surprisingly, debate can lead to correct answers even when all agents initially provide incorrect predictions. While computationally more expensive, the approach offers substantial improvements in LLM reliability and is compatible with black-box models, suggesting potential for self-improvement loops or enhanced data generation.",

Building upon Bayesian Theory-of-Mind and Rational Speech Act theory, the authors propose a novel Bayesian model that treats a human-robot team as a single group agent, thereby simplifying complex recursive mental reasoning. The model, implemented as a probabilistic program, includes a goal prior, a joint planner utilizing real-time A* search, and an utterance model that leverages a pre-trained neural language model (GPT-3 Curie) to interpret instructions based on salient actions. Through computational and human experiments in a multi-agent gridworld, the model's goal inferences were found to be highly correlated with human judgments. A key finding is that language instructions significantly accelerate goal inference, improve accuracy, and reduce observer uncertainty compared to relying solely on actions, though actions remain vital for disambiguating remaining ambiguities. These results validate the model as a plausible explanation for human goal inference and suggest a promising path for designing more communicative and cooperatively intelligent AI systems.",

It addresses the need for a systematic understanding of these agents, which overcome the limitations of traditional models by leveraging LLMs' human-like intelligence for self-directed planning and action in open-domain settings. The paper offers a structured analysis by focusing on three core aspects: construction, application, and evaluation. For construction, it proposes a unified agent architecture comprising profiling, memory, planning, and action modules, alongside categorizing capability acquisition strategies into fine-tuning and non-fine-tuning methods like prompt and mechanism engineering. It then extensively reviews the diverse applications of these agents across social science (psychology, social simulation, jurisprudence), natural science (experiment assistance, data management), and engineering (software development, robotics). Finally, the survey details evaluation methodologies, distinguishing between subjective (human annotation, Turing test) and objective (metrics, protocols, benchmarks) approaches. The findings consolidate existing research into comprehensive taxonomies, highlighting significant challenges such as role-playing accuracy, nuanced human alignment, prompt robustness, hallucination, controlling LLM knowledge in simulations, and inference speed, thereby guiding future research in this burgeoning domain.",

    "summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of creating interactive recommender systems that leverage the conversational power of Large Language Models (LLMs) while overcoming their limitations in handling domain-specific, private, or new item data. Traditional recommender systems lack conversational interfaces, and general LLMs often struggle with fine-grained recommendations, leading to issues like hallucination. To solve this, the authors propose InteRecAgent, a compact LLM-based agent framework that integrates LLMs with three distinct sets of traditional recommendation tools: querying, retrieval, and ranking. The framework introduces advanced modules including a \"shared candidate bus\" for efficient inter-tool communication of item candidates, \"long-term and short-term user profiles\" for enhanced personalization across dialogues, a \"dynamic demonstration-augmented plan-first strategy\" for robust and cost-effective task planning, and an \"actor-critic reflection strategy\" for error detection and correction. Furthermore, to democratize the framework, they developed RecLlama, a 7-billion-parameter LlaMA 2 model fine-tuned on a GPT-4 generated dataset of tool execution plans. Experiments on Steam, MovieLens, and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate InteRecAgent's superior performance in terms of hit rate and average turns in interactive recommendations, significantly outperforming general LLMs, particularly in less-covered, private domains like Amazon Beauty where LLMs often hallucinate. RecLlama also shows impressive capabilities, surpassing larger models and demonstrating strong generalization, making the framework more accessible. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each proposed mechanism to the overall effectiveness.",

This paper proposes ReConcile, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages a \"round-table conference\" among diverse LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude2) to improve reasoning via consensus. ReConcile involves agents initially generating answers, explanations, and confidence scores, followed by multi-round discussions. In each round, agents revise their responses by considering grouped answers, explanations, confidence from others, and \"convincing samples\" (human explanations that rectify incorrect answers). A weighted voting scheme, based on recalibrated confidence, determines the final team answer once consensus is reached. Experiments across seven benchmarks, including commonsense, mathematical, logical, and NLI tasks, demonstrate that ReConcile consistently outperforms strong single-agent (Self-Refine, Self-Consistency) and same-model multi-agent (Debate, Judge) baselines. Notably, ReConcile even surpasses GPT-4 on some benchmarks (e.g., StrategyQA, and MATH when incorporating DeepSeekMath).

Traditional LLM agent planning struggles with fine-grained, multi-constraint tasks requiring heterogeneous action sequences, often leading to suboptimal results. PMC tackles this by hierarchically decomposing a main task into subordinate sub-tasks via a manager agent, which also categorizes constraints as 'local' or 'global'. Executor agents then perform step-level planning and execution for each sub-task, adhering to local constraints, while a supervisor agent refines sub-tasks based on previous outcomes. Finally, a deliverer agent synthesizes all sub-task results to satisfy global constraints and produce the final outcome. Evaluated on two constraint-intensive benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank, PMC achieved a 42.68% success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly outperforming GPT-4 (2.92%), and surpassed GPT-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by 13.64%.

Existing memory-augmented methods often lack context-awareness and struggle with response correctness. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose CAIM, a Cognitive AI Memory Framework. CAIM integrates retrieval-augmented methods with cognitive AI principles, positioning the LLM as a central decision unit. It comprises three modules: a Memory Controller for selective retrieval, a Memory Retrieval module with a novel ontology-based tagging system and contextual/time-based filtering, and a Post-Thinking module for memory extension and review. Evaluated on the public Generated Virtual Dataset, CAIM significantly outperforms existing frameworks like MemoryBank and Think-in-Memory across metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and contextual coherence, particularly with GPT-4o. Ablation studies confirm the crucial roles of the Memory Controller and filtering mechanism. While CAIM enhances long-term interactions and personalization by effectively managing memory, it exhibits limitations in handling highly detailed queries and understanding relative time-based units due to its design prioritizing concise inductive thoughts over granular information.",

    "summary": "The paper introduces Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel framework addressing the challenge of dynamically configuring optimal communication topologies for multi-agent LLM systems. Current methods often rely on static, human-designed graphs or only prune communication links, overlooking the critical need to select the most relevant agents. AGP proposes a two-stage approach: first, it collects a diverse dataset of task-optimized subgraphs from a fixed agent pool, serving as ground-truth supervision for node masks and edge weights. Second, it trains a dual-pruning Graph Neural Network (GNN) that jointly performs hard pruning (selecting agent subsets) and soft pruning (optimizing communication strengths between agents) based on task semantics. Evaluated across six benchmarks spanning general, mathematical, and code reasoning, AGP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with an average improvement of 2.58% to 9.84% over existing baselines. Crucially, it drastically reduces inference token consumption by up to 90% and demonstrates superior training efficiency, converging faster than competitors. AGP's ability to adapt communication structures and agent teams dynamically, even discovering counter-intuitive yet effective agent combinations, makes it a highly efficient and adaptable solution for complex multi-agent LLM ecosystems.",

This paper introduces a novel framework for self-evolving LLM agents designed to autonomously improve their long-horizon strategic planning. The researchers developed four agent architectures, ranging from a basic LLM agent to sophisticated multi-agent systems (PromptEvolver and AgentEvolver) that iteratively refine prompts or rewrite their own game-playing code. These systems draw inspiration from multi-role AI frameworks and self-reflection techniques. Evaluating these agents against a strong heuristic-based bot (AlphaBeta) in Catanatron, the study demonstrates that agents with iterative self-improvement capabilities achieve consistently higher performance, exhibiting more coherent strategies and higher average victory points than static baselines. Notably, the PromptEvolver, especially when powered by stronger models like Claude 3.7, showed up to a 95% improvement.

    "summary": "Existing medical AI, primarily large language models (LLMs), excels at acquiring medical knowledge from text but struggles with practical expertise gained through hospital experience, a critical phase for human doctors. Current LLM-powered agents also lack the ability to continuously learn and evolve from interactions. This paper introduces \"Agent Hospital,\" a novel simulacrum where LLM-powered autonomous agents (patients, nurses, and doctors) interact in a virtual hospital environment. The proposed \"Simulacrum-based Evolutionary Agent Learning (SEAL)\" paradigm, featuring the MedAgent-Zero method, enables doctor agents to acquire and refine medical expertise. SEAL constructs the virtual hospital by coupling LLMs with medical knowledge bases to automatically generate diverse patient data, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Doctor agents then evolve by treating these patient agents, storing successful cases in a medical case base, and deriving rules from failures for an experience base. Evaluation in the virtual world shows significant improvements in medical examination selection, diagnosis, and treatment plan recommendation, with diagnostic accuracy consistently increasing as doctor agents treat more patients. Importantly, the expertise gained in Agent Hospital is transferable to real-world scenarios, as evolved doctor agents outperform state-of-the-art methods on the MedQA dataset without using any labeled training data from the benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of this self-evolutionary approach.",

The proposed solution is a novel agentic workflow named PReP (Perceive, Reflect, and Plan). PReP utilizes a fine-tuned LLaVA model for accurate visual perception of landmarks and inference of goal direction/distance. A memory module, encompassing episodic and semantic memory, enables the agent to reflect on past experiences, form a cognitive map, and make robust inferences even when landmarks are invisible. A planning module then generates long-term navigation plans, breaking down paths into sub-goals. Evaluated on datasets from four major cities, PReP significantly outperforms existing language-based and reinforcement learning baselines, achieving an average success rate of 54%.

The authors propose a two-pronged approach: first, fundamentally improving LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using a novel agent-specific dataset. This dataset is meticulously constructed by leveraging GPT-4 to simulate multi-turn dialogues between an agent, a user, and an environment, capturing interactive behaviors, internal thought processes, and decision-making. This agent data is then mixed with general instruction tuning data to preserve generalizability. Second, the approach integrates advanced reasoning strategies including task decomposition, which breaks complex tasks into simpler subtasks, and multi-path reasoning with backtracking, allowing the agent to explore alternative solutions and avoid suboptimal paths. Evaluated on AgentBench, the SFT with constructed agent data significantly boosts performance across tasks like Operating System and WebShop, outperforming other instruction tuning methods. The multi-branch reasoning further improves results, especially on planning-intensive (ALFWorld) and API invocation tasks, demonstrating a promising pathway to making smaller LLMs more effective and robust AI agents.",

    "summary": "Non-expert human planners face challenges in complex, dynamic environments, often struggling with symbolic planning tools due to their strict formats. While LLMs can translate natural language to symbolic specifications, they frequently introduce errors or miss user intent, and lack robust plan space exploration. This paper introduces PlanCritic, a neurosymbolic framework designed for collaborative human-AI planning. PlanCritic uses GPT-4 to convert user preferences into mid-level goals and initial PDDL constraints. It then employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize these constraints, leveraging an LSTM-based reward model trained with human feedback to evaluate plan adherence to natural language preferences, and an external symbolic planner (Optic) for plan generation. This approach allows PlanCritic to efficiently search the plan space beyond initial LLM outputs. Experimental results in a waterway restoration domain demonstrate that PlanCritic, with its GA-based optimization, achieves a 75% success rate in adapting plans to changing user preferences, significantly outperforming LLM-only approaches (53% success). PlanCritic is particularly effective at correcting initial LLM mistakes, succeeding 88% of the time when the LLM's initial guess is wrong, though it occasionally introduces errors in initially correct LLM plans due to reward model limitations with \"near miss\" scenarios.",

It proposes AgentCoder, a novel multi-agent framework featuring three specialized agents: a programmer agent for code generation and iterative refinement, a test designer agent for independently generating accurate, diverse, and comprehensive test cases (basic, edge, large-scale), and a test executor agent for dynamic code validation in a local environment. AgentCoder significantly outperforms 14 LLMs and 16 state-of-the-art optimization baselines, achieving an average of 91.5% and 84.1% pass@1 with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respectively, which is a notable improvement over prior SOTA (e.g., 8.8% higher than CodeCoT). Furthermore, AgentCoder drastically reduces token overhead (e.g., 56.9K for HumanEval compared to MetaGPT's 138.2K) and achieves superior test generation accuracy and code coverage, validating the effectiveness of its streamlined multi-agent design and objective test generation strategy.",

Addressing the limitations of static historical analysis and simplistic traditional simulations, WarAgent models countries as agents with detailed profiles (leadership, military, resources, history, policy, public morale) and a comprehensive action space (e.g., declare war, form alliances, send messages). The architecture includes secretary agents for action validation, a \"Board\" for public relations, and a \"Stick\" for internal states, efficiently managing context by consolidating historical data. To prevent LLMs from simply recalling historical facts, country names and minor historical details are anonymized. Experiments demonstrate WarAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4 achieving high accuracy in replicating historical alliance formations and military mobilizations. Counterfactual analyses reveal that even minor \"null\" triggers can escalate tensions into cold war scenarios, and that agent aggressiveness, historical background, key policies, and public morale are more influential in conflict initiation than military capacity or resources. The research positions LLM-based MAS as a powerful, ethical tool for computational social science, offering new perspectives for historians, policymakers, and educators by enabling the exploration of \"what-if\" scenarios and enhancing the understanding of complex human behaviors and conflict dynamics.",

The critic, unlike the actor, has access to training-time information (e.g., reference solutions) to improve credit assignment. SWEET-RL directly learns the advantage function, parameterized by the mean log probability of actions, using a trajectory-level Bradley-Terry objective. Experiments on ColBench demonstrate that SWEET-RL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms and even matches or surpasses proprietary models like GPT-4o and O1-Mini, showcasing the effectiveness of its design choices, particularly the use of asymmetric information and appropriate learning objectives for generalization.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a benchmark self-evolving framework designed to dynamically evaluate rapidly advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of static benchmarks, data contamination, and the need for fine-grained assessment. The core of the solution is a multi-agent system comprising an instance pre-filter, creator, verifier, and candidate option formulator, which reframes existing benchmark instances into new variants. It supports scalable evaluation (alternative/complex questions), robust evaluation (context paraphrasing, noising, polarity reversing), and fine-grained evaluation (probing sub-abilities). The framework ensures high data accuracy through a double-verification process and can be iteratively applied. Experimental results across seven diverse datasets and multiple LLMs demonstrate that the evolved benchmarks lead to a general performance decline for most models, revealing their true limitations in generalizability and robustness. The framework also widens performance discrepancies between models and across tasks, aiding in informed model selection, and effectively mitigates data contamination issues.

Unlike traditional LLM agents that require sophisticated manual prompt engineering for specific tasks, Agent-Pro employs a novel policy-level reflection and optimization mechanism. It first generates dynamic self- and world-beliefs to inform decision-making, then iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs to calibrate irrational understandings. These reflections are distilled into refined behavioral guidelines and world modeling, which are then integrated into the agent's prompt to evolve its policy. A Depth-First Search (DFS) based optimization process ensures continuous policy enhancement. Evaluated in Blackjack and Limit Texas Hold’em, Agent-Pro significantly outperforms vanilla LLMs and even specialized reinforcement learning models (DQN, DMC).

This paper introduces CORY (Coevolving with the Other You), a novel sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to address these challenges. CORY duplicates the LLM to be fine-tuned into two autonomous agents: a 'pioneer' and an 'observer'. The pioneer generates an initial response, which the observer then utilizes, alongside the original query, to produce its own response, facilitating knowledge transfer. To prevent prompt bias and foster robust, independent capabilities, the roles of these agents are periodically exchanged during training. Both agents are optimized collaboratively using a collective reward. Experiments conducted on GPT-2 and Llama-2 with subjective (IMDB Review) and objective (GSM8K) reward functions demonstrate that CORY significantly surpasses PPO in terms of policy optimality, resilience to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby offering a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.",

To address this gap, this paper introduces LLM-Evolve, a novel evaluation framework that transforms established benchmarks into sequential problem-solving settings. LLMs are evaluated across multiple rounds, receiving feedback on each round's outcome. This feedback is used to build a demonstration memory of successful input-output pairs, which the model can then query via a dense retriever for few-shot learning on future tasks. Applying LLM-Evolve to MMLU, GSM8K, and AgentBench, the study tested eight state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models. Results show that LLMs can achieve significant performance improvements, ranging from 1% to 17%, by leveraging past interactions. The quality of the retrieval algorithm and feedback signals critically influences this evolving capability, with more challenging benchmarks yielding higher gains.

The research surprisingly finds that simple model averaging, which interpolates between pre- and post-RLHF model weights, achieves the strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front compared to a wide range of other mitigation techniques. Theoretical insights are provided, explaining that model averaging enhances performance by increasing feature diversity in shared feature spaces, particularly within low-level transformer layers.

The method employs an Iterative DPO framework where the model autonomously generates new prompts, creates candidate responses, and then evaluates these responses using its own \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" capability to construct preference pairs.

Experiments with Llama 2 70B demonstrate significant iterative improvements in both instruction following performance (e.g., the Iteration 3 model achieves a 20.44% win rate against GPT-4 Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0) and the model's reward modeling ability (pairwise accuracy with human rankings improves from 78.7% to 81.7% across iterations), establishing a virtuous cycle of self-improvement.",

RLCD addresses the limitations of existing methods like RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback), which often generate noisy preference labels due to similar quality outputs, and context distillation, which lacks pairwise preference signal. RLCD generates preference pairs by employing two contrasting prompts: a positive prompt (p+) encouraging a desired attribute and a negative prompt (p-) encouraging its violation. This contrast leads to more differentiated model outputs (o+ and o-) and cleaner, automatically generated preference labels. These pairs are then used to train a preference model, which subsequently guides the LLM alignment via reinforcement learning (PPO). Empirically, RLCD significantly outperforms RLAIF and context distillation baselines across three diverse alignment tasks—harmlessness, helpfulness, and story outline generation—when simulating preference data with both LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-30B models.

Experimental results demonstrate RLC's effectiveness across various tasks: it significantly boosts answering accuracy on challenging BigBench-hard reasoning tasks (from 31.23% to 37.09%) and improves BERTScore for CNN/Daily Mail text summarization.

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes, the authors introduce a parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM). The WKM is trained to self-synthesize knowledge by comparing expert trajectories with those generated by an experienced agent (rejected trajectories). During inference, the WKM provides prior global task knowledge to guide the agent's overall planning and dynamic local state knowledge, obtained via kNN retrieval from a pre-built knowledge base, to constrain local actions. The next action is determined by a weighted combination of probabilities from the agent model and the WKM's retrieved state knowledge. Evaluated on three complex real-world simulated datasets—ALFWorld, WebShop, and ScienceWorld—with state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, Llama-3-8B), the method consistently achieves superior performance over various strong baselines, often surpassing GPT-4.

Existing solutions often require expensive external knowledge or training from scratch. SE addresses these limitations by operating in two stages: \"self-questioning,\" where the existing PLM identifies informative yet under-explored tokens based on its own prediction correctness and confidence, and \"self-evolution training,\" where the PLM learns from these tokens. To prevent overfitting to these challenging tokens, SE incorporates a novel Token-specific Label Smoothing (TLS) approach that adaptively regularizes training using the PLM's self-generated distributions. Experiments across 10 NLU tasks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD2.0, SWAG, and LAMA, demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements (e.g., +1.43 to +2.36 average scores) on various PLMs. Analyses confirm that SE enhances linguistic knowledge learning, model generalization, and robustness.",

Existing methods often fine-tune LLMs on entire expert trajectories, which can lead to these issues. ATLaS proposes to identify and utilize only the \"critical steps\" within expert trajectories for fine-tuning. An oracle LLM (GPT-4o) acts as a selector, categorizing critical steps into Plan Creation, Critical Observation, Critical Action, and Self Correction. By fine-tuning LLMs on a reduced set of critical steps (e.g., 30% of total tokens), ATLaS significantly cuts backpropagation costs and overfitting risks. Experiments demonstrate that ATLaS-finetuned agents achieve superior performance on both held-in and held-out tasks, outperforming baselines that fine-tune on full trajectories.

Current LLM-based code generation often relies on external retrievers for knowledge, leading to domain mismatch and finetuning issues, and frequently produces buggy code. SelfEvolve addresses these challenges by treating the LLM itself as a knowledge source, prompting it to generate multi-form necessary information based on problem intents, thereby circumventing external retrieval. Following this, it integrates an iterative self-refinement mechanism where the LLM uses an external executor (e.g., Python interpreter) to obtain feedback (pass/error messages) from authentic test cases derived from problem descriptions. This feedback guides the LLM to iteratively correct and evolve the preliminary code, mimicking human debugging. Evaluated on DS-1000, HumanEval, and TransCoder, SelfEvolve, primarily using gpt-3.5-turbo, demonstrates significant improvements over strong baselines like DocPrompting and Self-Debugging.

The approach involves two phases: Forward Reasoning, where LLMs generate multiple candidate answers using CoT and sampling, and Backward Verification. In Backward Verification, each candidate answer is used to predict a masked original condition from the problem context. A verification score is then computed based on the consistency between the predicted and actual masked values, allowing the selection of the most reliable answer.

This paper introduces CODET (CODE generation with generated Tests), a novel zero-shot method that leverages the same pre-trained LLMs to automatically generate a comprehensive set of test cases.

This synergistic approach allows the model to continuously improve its rationale generation capabilities, thereby enriching its training data. Experimental results on arithmetic, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K demonstrate that STaR significantly outperforms models fine-tuned to directly predict answers (+12.5% on CommonsenseQA) and few-shot baselines.

Existing LLM-based agents, while more flexible, still struggle with rigid planning, static beliefs, and limited persona representation, especially at city scale. CitySim introduces a scalable LLM-driven agent simulation framework designed to address these challenges. It equips agents with real-world-grounded personas (demographics, psychographics, habits), advanced memory (temporal, reflective, spatial with Kalman-filtered beliefs), dynamic needs prioritization, and Maslow's hierarchy-inspired long-term goal formation. Agents autonomously generate daily schedules through recursive, value-driven planning, select Points of Interest using a belief-aware gravity model, and choose transport modes, all powered by LLMs. A weighted social network with evolving beliefs governs agent interactions. CitySim demonstrates superior behavioral realism, accurately reproducing macro-level time-use distributions, human-like mobility patterns, and effectively predicting POI popularity and population well-being. It outperforms several strong baselines and scales efficiently to millions of agents, with ablation studies confirming the critical role of each module.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes an active inference-grounded actor-critic prompting protocol. The system features a 'Therapist agent' that generates initial responses to patient queries and a 'Supervisor agent' that refines these responses for factual accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness, leveraging a domain-specific, validated knowledge base and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A blind validation study was conducted where 100 patient queries, related to Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), were evaluated by experienced CBT-I therapists. Responses from the LLM-based Virtual Sleep Coach (VSC) were compared against appropriate and inappropriate human-crafted responses. The VSC responses consistently received high ratings, often outperforming the appropriate human responses (mean 4.327 vs 4.071 on a 1-5 Likert scale, p=7.1x10^-5), indicating effective alignment with expert standards. The study also found that longer responses tended to receive higher ratings and that a separate LLM (ChatGPT o1) could accurately distinguish between human and LLM-generated responses based on characteristics like formality and tone. This structured approach demonstrates a foundation for safely integrating advanced LLM technology into medical applications.",

This research addresses this gap by developing MetaMedQA, an enhanced benchmark derived from MedQA-USMLE, which incorporates confidence scores and specific metacognitive tasks, including questions with fictional content, malformed questions, and modified answers. The study evaluated twelve diverse LLMs on metrics such as confidence-based accuracy, missing answer recall (identifying \"None of the above\"), and unknown recall (recognizing unanswerable questions). The findings reveal significant metacognitive deficiencies across all models, with LLMs consistently failing to recognize their knowledge limitations and often providing confident answers even when no correct option was present. While GPT-4o demonstrated the best, albeit still limited, ability to vary its confidence levels, most models scored 0% on unknown recall. Prompt engineering showed some improvement for GPT-4o, but required explicit and exhaustive instructions.

    "summary": "The research addresses the critical challenge of evaluating recommender systems (RS), where offline metrics often fail to predict real-world user engagement, and online A/B testing is costly and slow. Existing LLM-based user agents for RS evaluation often lack comprehensive user personas, external knowledge integration, visual signal processing, and sophisticated decision-making mechanisms. To overcome this, the paper proposes SimUSER, a two-phase LLM-empowered agent framework. Phase 1 focuses on self-consistent persona matching, leveraging LLMs to extract detailed personas (including age, personality, occupation, pickiness, habits, and unique tastes) from historical user data. Phase 2 employs a cognitive architecture for agents, comprising persona, multimodal perception (using image-derived captions), episodic memory, and knowledge-graph memory (for user-item relationships). A 'brain' module orchestrates multi-round preference elicitation, causal action refinement, and post-interaction reflection using Chain-of-Thought prompting. Experimental results demonstrate SimUSER agents' superior performance over baselines (RecAgent, Agent4Rec) in item classification and rating prediction, exhibiting lower RMSE/MAE. Crucially, SimUSER shows higher correlation with real-world A/B test business metrics (average visited pages) and its interactions are perceived as more human-like. The framework successfully replicates psychological effects like exposure bias and the influence of visual thumbnails and reviews on user behavior, while its KG memory enhances robustness against LLM hallucination for unfamiliar items.

This paper introduces Motif, a method to bridge this gap by deriving an intrinsic reward function from a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM). Motif leverages an LLM to express preferences over pairs of high-level event captions extracted from observation datasets, distilling these preferences into a reward function that guides Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. The LLM acts as an annotator, requiring only coarse textual descriptions of events. Evaluated on the challenging NetHack Learning Environment, Motif drastically improves agent performance, even surpassing agents trained directly with extrinsic rewards in the score task and achieving significant progress in the extremely sparse oracle task without expert demonstrations. The system fosters human-aligned behaviors, generates anticipatory rewards that simplify credit assignment, and demonstrates scalability with LLM size and prompt quality. Motif also allows for steerable behavior through natural language prompts, though it reveals a 'misalignment by composition' phenomenon where combined rewards can lead to unintended, yet effective, solutions.",

Unlike prior work focusing solely on user agents or verbalizing interactions, AgentCF models both users and items as autonomous LLM-powered agents, each equipped with memory modules. The core innovation lies in a collaborative optimization framework where user and item agents autonomously interact, and a collaborative reflection mechanism enables mutual adjustment of their memories based on discrepancies with real-world interactions. This process implicitly propagates preferences, mimicking the core idea of collaborative filtering. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentCF outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in recommendation tasks, achieving comparable performance to models trained on full datasets with only a fraction of the data. Furthermore, AgentCF successfully simulates diverse human-like behaviors, including user-user interactions, item cold-start alleviation, preference propagation, and collective intelligence in advertisement creation, highlighting its potential for next-generation user behavior simulation.",

The simulator operates in a page-by-page recommendation environment with extensible collaborative filtering algorithms. Experiments demonstrate Agent4Rec's capability to accurately simulate human-like behaviors: agents consistently identify preferred items (around 65% accuracy, 75% recall), exhibit rating distributions aligned with real data, and show behaviors influenced by social traits. Agent4Rec successfully evaluates recommendation strategies, showing higher agent satisfaction with algorithmic approaches (e.g., LightGCN outperforming MF/MultVAE), replicates feedback-driven recommendation enhancement, and reveals the filter bubble effect. Furthermore, it facilitates causal discovery by inferring relationships between movie attributes, exposure, views, and ratings, highlighting the influence of quality and popularity, and the amplification of popularity bias.

    "summary": "This research reveals a critical vulnerability in medical large language models (LLMs) to targeted misinformation attacks, posing significant risks to healthcare applications. The study demonstrates a novel gradient-based method that can deliberately inject incorrect biomedical facts into LLMs by modifying as little as 1.1% of the model's weights, specifically within the multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers. The injected misinformation is shown to propagate confidently and consistently in the model's output, generalize to different contexts, and persist over time. Crucially, these attacks are stealthy, as they do not compromise the LLM's general performance, making them difficult to detect through standard metrics like perplexity. The proposed rank-one update method for weight modification significantly outperforms traditional data poisoning techniques in effectiveness, locality, and portability. Furthermore, the attacks can bypass state-of-the-art LLM safety measures, increasing jailbreaking success rates on models like Llama-3 from 2% to 58%.

Existing hierarchical planning methods, often relying on Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with the complexity, dynamic nature, and vast state space of such domains. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose \"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\" (DEPS), an interactive planning framework. DEPS employs an iterative loop where a descriptor summarizes execution failures, an LLM acts as an explainer to diagnose plan errors, and then as a planner to revise the plan. Complementing this, a learned horizon-predictive selector prioritizes sub-goals based on their estimated completion time, enhancing planning efficiency. Evaluated on 71 challenging tasks in open-world Minecraft, DEPS demonstrated superior performance, nearly doubling the overall success rate compared to baselines and achieving the long-standing \"ObtainDiamond\" task.

The solution involves players guiding an LLM-driven AI King to narrate keyword-rich tales, where specific keywords (e.g., \"sword\") spoken by the King materialize as tangible in-game items (weapons). The game dynamically generates and visualizes the story world using text-to-image models, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality. GPT-4 is employed for story evaluation and continuation, ensuring coherence and guiding player input. The results demonstrate how GenAI can be fundamental to novel game mechanics, enabling real-time multimodal content generation, enhancing player engagement through natural language input, and providing a framework for balancing player freedom with narrative integrity, thereby defining a new category of \"AI-Native games.\"",

While the LMs successfully replicated findings and even gender-sensitive effects in the first three TEs, the Wisdom of Crowds TE revealed a peculiar \"hyper-accuracy distortion\" in newer, highly-aligned models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4).

The core problem is that while LLMs can decompose high-level tasks (e.g., \"make breakfast\") into plausible mid-level plans, these plans are often not executable due to linguistic ambiguities, missing common-sense steps, or non-admissible actions specific to the environment. The proposed solution involves a procedure that semantically translates LLM-generated action phrases to admissible actions using a pre-trained masked LLM (Translation LM), employs autoregressive trajectory correction by conditioning future generation on already translated admissible actions, and utilizes dynamic example selection for improved in-context learning. Evaluated in the VirtualHome environment, the method significantly boosts executability from a naive LLM baseline of 18% to 79%.

The core of the work involves an extensive data preparation pipeline, including scraping physician opening hours from www.herold.at, cleaning and enriching this data, and then probabilistically matching it with patient contact data. This complex matching process, which combined direct assignments and an optimization-based approach, successfully integrated capacity information for 4,288 physicians, while missing data for others was imputed based on similar matched physicians. The prepared data then feeds into an agent-based model to simulate the impact of physician unavailability on system resilience, measured by indicators such as lost patients (LLP) and free capacity (LFC). The simulations revealed varying resilience levels across different medical specialities and federal states in Austria. For instance, general practitioners showed specific patterns in opening hours and patient contacts, while specialties like internal medicine and radiology demonstrated distinct vulnerabilities to physician removal. To facilitate exploration of these complex results, an interactive online visualization tool was developed, offering aggregate and detailed views of resilience indicators, physician profiles, and patient displacement networks.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the significant bottleneck in training web navigation agents: the reliance on costly, limited, and static human-annotated data. The authors propose InSTA, an automatic, three-stage pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training. The pipeline consists of an LLM-based task proposer that generates tasks across 150,000 diverse websites, an agent that executes these tasks to create trajectories, and an LLM-based judge that evaluates and filters the resulting data. This creates a scalable data flywheel that reduces dependency on human intervention. Using data from this pipeline, the researchers trained a 1.7B parameter model that achieved a 56.9% success rate, outperforming much larger frontier models like a 235B parameter Qwen model and Llama 4 Maverick. The trained agents also demonstrated strong zero-shot transferability to unseen benchmarks like WebVoyager, validating the quality and generalizability of the automatically generated data.",

The benchmark tasks are automatically constructed from recent, high-quality Kaggle notebooks to ensure realism and mitigate data contamination. Evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a critical challenge: balancing advanced reasoning with robust instruction-following.

The authors introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing authentic agent personas by integrating three core components of an individual's self-concept: Social Identity (S) from demographic data, Personal Identity (P) from psychometric scales (BFI-2-S, PVQ), and Personal Life Context (C) from short essays on preferences and daily routines. The framework's effectiveness was evaluated through both automated tests with popular drama characters and human evaluations with real-world individuals. Automated evaluations showed that the Personal Life Context (C) alone was highly effective, performing comparably to the full SPC combination for fictional characters. However, human evaluations revealed a different pattern: for real individuals, the full SPC combination provided a significantly more comprehensive and accurate self-representation than any single component, including C. This divergence highlights that while contextual narratives are powerful, a holistic integration of demographic, psychological, and contextual data is crucial for authentically simulating real-world individuals, especially those underrepresented in LLM training data.",

The authors propose the Adaptive Mode Learning (AML) framework, which equips agents with adaptive thinking capabilities. AML introduces four hierarchical thinking modes, inspired by cognitive theory, ranging from intuitive responses to deep, strategic deliberation. The training process involves an initial behavioral cloning phase to teach the model these modes, followed by reinforcement learning using a novel algorithm called Adaptive Mode Policy Optimization (AMPO). AMPO's key innovation is its advantage function, which incorporates both mode-level (comparing average reward and token length across modes) and sample-level information. This allows the agent to dynamically select the most appropriate thinking mode based on the context, balancing performance with token efficiency. Experimental results on the SOTOPIA benchmark show that AML achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by up to 15.6%, while AMPO significantly reduces token usage compared to existing RL methods.",

The authors propose an agentic workflow named 'Perceive, Reflect, and Plan' (PReP). The 'Perceive' module uses a fine-tuned LLaVA model to identify landmarks and estimate their direction and distance. The 'Reflect' module employs a memory system, inspired by human cognition, to build an internal cognitive map from historical trajectories and observations, allowing the agent to infer its position even when landmarks are not visible. Finally, the 'Plan' module uses the refined goal information to create and update a long-term navigation plan composed of sub-goals, guiding the agent's actions. Experiments conducted on newly created datasets for four cities (Beijing, Shanghai, New York, Paris) show that the PReP agent significantly outperforms baselines like React and RL methods, achieving an average success rate of 54%. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed workflow and highlight the crucial roles of both reflection and planning in enabling complex spatial reasoning for LLM agents.",

The authors propose a two-pronged strategy to enhance the capabilities of these low-parameter models. The first approach involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using a custom-built dataset. This dataset is generated by leveraging GPT-4 to simulate multi-role interactions (e.g., question generator, action maker, environment) to create rich, multi-turn conversational data reflecting agent thought processes and actions. This agent-specific data is mixed with general instruction data to preserve the model's broad knowledge. The second approach, termed multi-branch reasoning, improves inference-time performance without further model changes. It combines task decomposition, which breaks down complex goals into simpler sub-tasks, with backtracking, a multi-path reasoning mechanism that allows the agent to explore alternative solutions when a path proves suboptimal. Experiments conducted on the AgentBench benchmark demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the performance of 7B and 13B models, reducing common issues like hallucinations and enhancing success rates on complex agent tasks.",

    "summary": "This paper identifies two key gaps in evaluating LLM-based generative agents: the lack of a standardized interface for connecting diverse agent architectures to various benchmarks, and the over-reliance on binary success/fail metrics which offer limited insight for debugging. To address this, the authors introduce AgentQuest, a modular benchmark framework that provides a unified driver to streamline agent-environment integration. More critically, AgentQuest proposes two new metrics: Progress Rate, which tracks an agent's advancement towards a solution by measuring reached milestones, and Repetition Rate, which quantifies the agent's tendency to repeat similar actions. The authors demonstrate the framework's utility across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, Lateral Thinking Puzzles, and the newly introduced Mastermind and Sudoku). By analyzing the interplay of these new metrics, they show how to diagnose specific failure modes. For instance, in the Mastermind benchmark, high repetition and stalled progress led to an architectural improvement (adding a memory buffer) that increased the success rate by approximately 20%. This work provides a practical tool for researchers to not only measure but also understand and improve agent performance.",

The environment is fully self-hosted and reproducible, integrating open-source tools like GitLab, OwnCloud, and RocketChat, and uniquely features LLM-powered simulated colleagues to test interaction. The evaluation is granular, using a checkpoint system to award partial credit for long-horizon tasks. Experiments with twelve prominent LLMs, using the OpenHands agent framework, reveal that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, only achieves a 30.3% full completion rate. The results show that agents struggle significantly with tasks requiring social interaction and navigation of complex user interfaces, even more so than with technical coding tasks. This suggests that while agents show promise, they are far from automating the full spectrum of workplace activities, highlighting key areas for future development.",

The authors identify three key issues with current agent fine-tuning: 1) training data entangles format-following with reasoning, deviating from the model's pre-trained conversational domain; 2) models learn different agent-related capabilities at varying speeds; and 3) existing methods often introduce or worsen hallucination problems. To solve this, they propose Agent-FLAN, a fine-tuning methodology that redesigns the training process. Agent-FLAN aligns agent data with a natural chat format to decouple format from reasoning, decomposes tasks into fundamental capabilities (e.g., reasoning, retrieval) to allow for balanced data mixing based on learning difficulty, and introduces negative sample learning to mitigate hallucinations. The authors also create the Agent-H benchmark to specifically evaluate agent hallucinations. Applied to the Llama2-7B model, Agent-FLAN outperforms previous best methods by 3.5% on average across several agent evaluation benchmarks and significantly reduces hallucinations, while also showing positive scaling with model size.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, adopting a life-cycle assessment (LCA) perspective. The authors aim to quantify emissions beyond the typical scope of dynamic power consumption during training. They meticulously calculate the contributions from three key areas: embodied emissions from manufacturing the server and GPU hardware, dynamic power consumption from the active training process, and idle power consumption from the supporting infrastructure. The study finds that BLOOM's final training emitted 50.5 tonnes of CO2eq in total, with dynamic consumption accounting for less than half of this figure (24.7 tonnes). Embodied emissions and idle consumption represent 22.2% and 28.9% of the total, respectively, highlighting their significance. Furthermore, the paper includes an empirical study on the energy cost of deploying BLOOM for inference, revealing a substantial continuous power draw even with low request volumes. The authors conclude by comparing BLOOM's footprint to other large models, emphasizing the critical impact of low-carbon energy grids, and advocating for more granular and transparent reporting standards in the ML community.",

The authors address the problem that state-of-the-art LLMs were often proprietary and prohibitively large, hindering broader research. Their solution was to train smaller models on a massive amount of data (trillions of tokens) sourced exclusively from publicly available datasets. This approach prioritizes inference efficiency, arguing that a smaller model trained for longer is more economical to deploy at scale than a larger, faster-to-train model. The results demonstrate the success of this strategy: LLaMA-13B outperforms the much larger GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with leading models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.

The authors evaluated PALMS on GPT-3 models of various sizes against baseline and control models. The results demonstrate that PALMS-tuned models perform significantly better across multiple metrics: they achieve lower toxicity scores, receive higher human evaluation ratings for adherence to the target values, and exhibit more neutral word associations for social categories like race, gender, and religion. Notably, the effectiveness of the process increases with model size, and it achieves these behavioral changes with a surprisingly small dataset (80 examples) without significantly compromising the model's general capabilities.",

By masking irrelevant regions, RTBAS prevents unnecessary propagation of malicious (low-integrity) or confidential data, a problem known as label creep.

The study conducts extensive experiments across various frameworks (AutoGen, Camel), communication structures (Chain, Tree, Complete, Random), and real-world applications (MetaGPT, ChatDev). The results demonstrate that AiTM achieves high attack success rates, often exceeding 70%, revealing that communication mechanisms are a significant weak point in current LLM-MAS architectures.

The authors argue that this memory, often containing sensitive information, is a significant and underexplored attack surface. To demonstrate this vulnerability, they propose the Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA), a black-box attack method. MEXTRA features a novel two-part prompt design that first locates the desired private data within the agent's context and then aligns the output format with the agent's specific workflow, enabling extraction even from non-textual agents (e.g., web or code-powered agents). The paper also introduces an automated method to generate diverse attacking prompts tailored to different levels of attacker knowledge. Through empirical evaluation on healthcare and online shopping agents, the study shows that MEXTRA can effectively extract a substantial number of private user queries.

Corba operates by injecting a malicious prompt into a single agent, which then enters an infinite recursive blocking state.

The authors argue that existing jailbreak methods for single LLMs are insufficient for complex agentic systems due to factors like agent quantity, role definitions, and interaction environments. To analyze these risks, they first use a template-based attack to show that attack success rates increase with the number of agents. The core contribution is \"Evil Geniuses\" (EG), a novel multi-agent framework designed to autonomously generate sophisticated, role-specific jailbreak prompts. EG employs a Red-Blue team structure—comprising a Harmful Prompt Writer, a Suitability Reviewer, and a Toxicity Tester—to refine attacks for both system-level and agent-level targets. Evaluations on agent frameworks like CAMEL, MetaGPT, and ChatDev, using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, demonstrate high attack success rates.

To implement this, they developed \"Task Shield,\" a test-time defense mechanism that acts as a guardian for the LLM agent. Task Shield continuously monitors the conversation, extracts all actionable instructions from the user, assistant, and external tools, and uses an LLM to verify that each new instruction contributes to the user's stated goals.

Through extensive experiments on the AgentDoJo benchmark with models like GPT-4o, Task Shield demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing attack success rates to as low as 2.07% while maintaining high task completion utility, thus achieving a superior security-utility trade-off compared to existing defense methods.",

The authors demonstrate that an adversary can compromise an entire network of millions of agents exponentially fast by initially infecting just a single agent.

When an infected agent communicates, it is induced to share the adversarial image from its memory album, which is then stored by the receiving agent, thereby propagating the infection. The paper formalizes these infectious dynamics using a mathematical model analogous to epidemiological models, deriving a condition (β > 2γ, where β is infection rate and γ is recovery rate) under which the infection's spread is unstoppable. Through large-scale simulations with up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, the study empirically validates the theoretical model, showing that a single infected agent can lead to system-wide compromise in a logarithmic number of interaction rounds, a significant threat to the large-scale deployment of MLLM agents.",

The FITD attack involves presenting the agent with a small, harmless request (a 'distractor') immediately before a malicious one. This exploits the agent's procedural nature, as the paper hypothesizes that ReAct agents primarily perform safety checks during the 'thought' generation phase and are less likely to re-evaluate actions once they are part of the plan. Experimental results demonstrate that FITD increases the attack success rate by up to 44.8% across various models. To address this vulnerability, the authors propose and evaluate three reflection-based defense mechanisms of varying intrusiveness: self-reflection, a hesitation reflector, and a general safety agent.

The authors introduce the concept of an \"Agent Constitution,\" a set of safety principles focused on actions and tool use, distinct from existing AI constitutions that target verbal harm.

This includes a (1) pre-planning strategy to instill safety knowledge via regulation and hindsight learning, (2) an in-planning strategy that uses dynamically retrieved regulations to guide plan generation in real-time, and (3) a post-planning strategy where a safety inspector agent reviews and revises the generated plan before execution. Experiments across five domains (housekeeping, finance, medicine, chemistry, food) with multiple LLMs demonstrate that TrustAgent significantly improves both the safety and helpfulness of agent-generated plans.

The paper categorizes architectures into single-agent and multi-agent systems, further dividing the latter into vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (collaborative) structures. It examines specific frameworks like ReAct, Reflexion, and LATS for single-agent patterns, and AgentVerse, MetaGPT, and DyLAN for multi-agent patterns, highlighting their distinct approaches to problem-solving. The authors find that while single-agent systems are effective for well-defined tasks, multi-agent systems excel in scenarios requiring collaboration, parallelization, and diverse feedback. The paper concludes that successful agent design, regardless of architecture, relies on key principles such as clear role definition, iterative feedback loops, dedicated planning phases, and structured communication. It also identifies significant challenges in the field, particularly the lack of standardized benchmarks, issues with reliability, and the inheritance of biases from underlying language models.",

The authors address the problem that while LLM agents offer immense potential, their complex, interactive nature introduces novel vulnerabilities beyond those of static LLMs. The paper systematically categorizes threats into two main groups: inherited threats from underlying LLMs (e.g., hallucinations, jailbreaking, data extraction) and unique, agent-specific threats that target the agent's workflow (knowledge poisoning, functional manipulation, and output manipulation). To illustrate these risks, the paper utilizes a running case study of a virtual town populated by LLM agents, demonstrating the real-world impact of attacks on users, the environment, and inter-agent communication. The survey also reviews existing mitigation strategies for each threat category and concludes by discussing future trends and challenges, particularly the security implications of emerging Multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents and LLM Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems, thereby providing a foundational guide for researchers and developers.",

The core problem is that advanced tool-use capabilities are typically confined to large, proprietary models like GPT-4, which are inaccessible and computationally expensive. The proposed solution is a self-instruction pipeline where a powerful 'teacher' model (GPT-3.5) is prompted with multi-modal context (image captions, object locations) and tool definitions to generate a large-scale, instruction-following dataset. This dataset is augmented with negative samples (deciding not to use a tool) and contextual samples (multi-step interactions) to improve robustness. Open-source LLMs are then efficiently fine-tuned on this dataset using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experiments show that this method significantly improves the models' ability to use seen tools (e.g., Vicuna-13B's success rate jumps from 12.4% to 94.1%) and, crucially, enables them to generalize and use unseen tools with performance comparable to GPT-3.5.",

Existing methods for integrating external tools can disrupt the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process. This paper introduces ChatCoT, a tool-augmented reasoning framework that models the entire process as a multi-turn conversation with a chat-based LLM. Instead of a single, continuous generation, ChatCoT breaks down reasoning into a series of conversational turns.

This iterative, conversational approach allows for a more natural and flexible integration of tool use without interrupting the logical flow.

The authors address the limitation of conventional LFQA systems that use static, non-interactive retrieval. They developed a web interface to record human annotators' real-time search behaviors, including issuing queries, browsing pages, and extracting supporting facts. This process yielded a dataset of 5,500 high-quality question-answer pairs, along with over 125,000 recorded web search actions. The authors propose a modular framework consisting of a 'search model' and a 'synthesis model'. The search model, trained via behavioral cloning on fine-tuned language models, imitates human actions for information retrieval. The synthesis model then generates a coherent, paragraph-length answer from the collected facts. Experiments show that a pipeline using a 10B parameter model generates answers that are comparable to or better than human-written ones 32.5% of the time on their dataset and demonstrates strong out-of-distribution generalization on the DuReader dataset.",

Second, using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique (LoRA) to adapt a pre-trained code model (like CodeGen) to this new dataset, enabling it to learn when and how to call a search tool. Third, integrating this tool-use capability into the decoding process, allowing the model to autonomously query a search tool (either an online engine for public libraries or a documentation-based retriever for private ones) and use the results to generate more accurate code.

Once a toolken is generated, the model enters a special \"tool mode\" to generate the required arguments, guided by specific in-context examples for that tool.

The core problem addressed is that LLMs often fail at tasks requiring both precise calculations and specialized domain knowledge, as they are prone to arithmetic errors and have limited, static knowledge. The proposed solution uses few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to teach GPT-3 how to generate reasoning steps that include special 'tool triggers.' When a trigger is detected, the system executes the corresponding external tool (e.g., a calculator, a chemical reaction predictor, a molar mass list) and injects the result back into the reasoning chain for the LLM to continue.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of modeling agent heterogeneity and long-term dynamics in traditional agent-based models (ABM) for macroeconomics. The authors introduce EconAgent, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent designed for simulating economic activities. The framework consists of a simulation environment with labor, consumption, and financial markets, and agents that make work and consumption decisions. Each EconAgent is endowed with a unique profile (age, job) through a perception module to foster heterogeneity. A memory module allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market trends, influencing their sequential decisions. Experimental results show that simulations using EconAgent produce more stable and realistic macroeconomic phenomena, such as inflation and unemployment rates, compared to rule-based and reinforcement learning-based agents. Furthermore, the EconAgent framework successfully reproduces classic economic regularities like the Phillips Curve and Okun's Law, demonstrating its ability to capture complex, human-like economic behavior.",

The paper proposes TRICE (Tool-leaRning wIth exeCution fEedback), a two-stage training framework designed to teach LLMs when and how to use tools effectively. The first stage, Behavior Cloning, involves supervised fine-tuning to make the model imitate tool-invoking behavior.

This stage uses a ranking loss to align the model's outputs with more desirable responses, encouraging selective tool use. Experimental results across eight benchmark datasets and various models (ChatGLM, Alpaca, Vicuna) demonstrate that TRICE significantly improves performance over standard fine-tuning and prompting methods.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of early and accurate diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms. The authors propose SARA, an LLM-based agentic framework designed for RA screening. To ground the system in real-world clinical data, they introduce PreRAID, a new dataset of 160 consented patients. SARA employs a multi-stage reasoning process by decomposing the diagnostic task among different agent configurations: a single agent (Solo), a two-agent pipeline (Duo), and a three-agent pipeline (Trio). These agents leverage the PreRAID dataset as a knowledge base to analyze patient symptoms and generate a diagnosis with human-readable explanations. Through extensive experiments, the Duo agent configuration achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy of 95%, outperforming both simpler and more complex setups.

The authors propose the Interactive Graph Discovery Agent (IGDA), an LLM-based pipeline that leverages semantic metadata about variables rather than numerical data. IGDA operates in two key phases: first, it selects edges for experimentation by prioritizing those with the highest uncertainty, as estimated by the LLM's confidence in its own predictions. Second, after receiving binary feedback from an experiment on a specific edge, the LLM performs local updates, revising its predictions and confidence scores for neighboring, un-tested edges. Experiments conducted on eight real-world graphs demonstrate that IGDA frequently outperforms baselines like random selection and a state-of-the-art numerical method. Ablation studies confirm that both the uncertainty-driven selection and the local update strategy are crucial for its success.

The core problem addressed is that single-pass LLMs struggle with complex, multi-step tasks that require exploration and self-correction. MALT decomposes the reasoning process into a sequential pipeline of three specialized agents: a Generator, a Verifier, and a Refiner. To train these agents without human supervision, the method first generates a large search tree of reasoning trajectories by sampling from each agent. It then uses a value iteration technique to propagate a binary reward signal (based on the final answer's correctness) backward through the tree, automatically assigning credit or blame to each intermediate step. This creates a large-scale dataset of positive and negative examples for each agent's role, which is then used for post-training via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experiments on MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA show that MALT significantly outperforms the baseline LLM and other fine-tuning approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of training specialized agents for collaborative problem-solving.",

The authors identify key limitations in existing agents, such as reliance on platform-specific textual data (e.g., HTML), fragmented action spaces, and dependency on closed-source models for reasoning. To overcome these challenges, AGUVIS proposes a vision-centric approach with a standardized action space (using pyautogui) that enables cross-platform generalization between web, mobile, and desktop environments. A core innovation is the incorporation of 'inner monologue' into the agent's training, compelling it to generate structured reasoning and planning steps before acting. This is enabled by a large-scale dataset, AGUVIS DATA COLLECTION, created with multimodal grounding and VLM-augmented reasoning annotations, and a novel two-stage training pipeline that separates GUI grounding from planning. Experiments show that AGUVIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on various offline and online benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and generalization, all while using open-source models.",

This practice leads to high computational costs and can overwhelm the agent's decision-making process. To solve this, the authors introduce EcoAct, a simple yet effective algorithm that integrates tool registration into the agent's reasoning procedure. Instead of pre-loading tool details, EcoAct provides the agent with only a list of tool names and a single meta-tool, tool_register. The agent can then use its intrinsic reasoning to decide when to call this meta-tool to register a specific tool, loading its full details into the context only as needed. Extensive experiments on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrate that EcoAct can reduce computational costs by over 50% in multi-step tasks involving many tools, while maintaining comparable or even slightly improved performance. The method is designed as a plug-and-play component, making it universally applicable to various agent reasoning pipelines.",

Existing outcome-based reward models fail to penalize inefficient intermediate steps, leading to suboptimal policies. The authors propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), a novel framework that improves inference-time performance by generating process-level rewards. QLASS first uses a fine-tuned agent to build an exploration tree of possible trajectories for a given task. It then applies principles from Q-learning, using the Bellman equation to recursively estimate the long-term value (Q-value) for each state-action node in the tree. These estimated Q-values serve as supervised data to train a Q-network (QNet). During inference, the agent uses this QNet to score potential actions at each step, enabling a Q-guided search strategy that prioritizes actions with higher expected long-term rewards. Experiments on WebShop, ALFWorld, and SciWorld show that QLASS significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrates superior search efficiency, and maintains high performance even with substantially reduced annotated data.",

    "summary": "This position paper analyzes the novel safety and security risks introduced by LLM-powered agents in scientific domains. The authors argue that while these agents show promise for automating experiments and discovery, their capabilities create significant vulnerabilities. The paper introduces a taxonomy of risks based on user intent, scientific domain (e.g., chemical, biological), and environmental impact. It then deconstructs the agent architecture to pinpoint vulnerabilities within its core modules, including the base LLM, planning, action, tool use, and memory. To address these issues, the authors propose a triadic framework for safeguarding, which involves human regulation (e.g., user licensing, audits), agent alignment (improving the model's intrinsic safety), and agent regulation through environmental feedback (e.g., using simulations to anticipate consequences). The central thesis is that the AI community must prioritize safeguarding and behavioral safety over the unchecked pursuit of greater agent autonomy, advocating for robust benchmarks, specialized models, and comprehensive regulations.",

The authors propose MedAgents, a novel, training-free Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC) framework that enhances zero-shot medical reasoning. The framework simulates a panel of medical experts by using role-playing LLM-based agents. The process involves five stages: gathering domain-specific agents based on the query, having each agent propose an individual analysis, summarizing these into a report, conducting a multi-round discussion to revise the report until consensus is reached, and finally making a decision. Experiments on nine medical datasets, including MedQA and MedMCQA, show that this collaborative approach significantly outperforms standard zero-shot baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and achieves performance comparable to strong few-shot methods. The study highlights that this method effectively elicits latent medical knowledge from LLMs and improves reasoning interpretability, with the main limitation being the inherent knowledge gaps within the base LLM itself.",

The first, 'auto-suggestive delusion', occurs when a model is trained on data from experts who rely on hidden information; the simulated agent then incorrectly interprets its own actions as evidence for this unobserved information. The second, a novel limitation termed 'predictor-policy incoherence', causes the agent to act conservatively because its predictions are based on the average, often suboptimal, policies in its training data, rather than its own potentially optimal future policy. The authors argue that these are structural failures not solvable by scaling models or data alone. They propose and demonstrate that both issues can be mitigated by iteratively fine-tuning the model on trajectories generated by its own actions. Through formal proofs and experiments with Decision Transformers in simple games, they show that this feedback loop reduces both failure modes and allows the agent's policy to converge towards optimality, providing a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of online learning methods like RLHF.",

The authors propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system inspired by human reading strategies. ReadAgent operates in three main steps, all implemented via prompting a pre-trained LLM: (1) it segments a long document into meaningful 'episodes' or 'pages' (Episode Pagination); (2) it compresses each page into a concise 'gist memory' (Memory Gisting); and (3) when faced with a task, it consults the full gist memory to decide which original pages to 'look up' for relevant details before generating an answer (Interactive Look-up). Evaluated on long-document comprehension tasks like QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum, ReadAgent significantly outperforms baselines using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and even surpasses the performance of using the full, uncompressed text where possible.

The core problem addressed is the over-reliance on expensive and opaque closed-source models like GPT-4, and the performance gap of existing open-source agents.

To train these modules, the authors created a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ~40K annotations by using GPT-4 to convert the reasoning steps from existing benchmarks into a unified format, rather than generating them from scratch. The framework is tested in two modes: an efficient one-shot 'Onetime' mode and a more adaptive 'Iterative' mode.

To address this, they propose a novel unsupervised training objective called 'regret-loss,' which aims to directly minimize the worst-case regret.

The authors construct a test-bed of multi-agent \"societies\" where agents are assigned specific traits (easy-going or overconfident) and engage in problem-solving using distinct thinking patterns (debate or reflection). By evaluating these societies on three benchmark datasets (MMLU, MATH, Chess Move Validity), the study analyzes how different collaborative strategies, defined as sequences of thinking patterns, impact performance and efficiency. The key finding is that the collaborative strategy itself is more crucial than the agents' assigned traits, with debate-initial and debate-dominant strategies often outperforming previous methods while using fewer API tokens. Furthermore, the research observes that LLM agents exhibit human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus-reaching, which can be both beneficial and detrimental to task outcomes.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of improving multi-step reasoning LLM agents, which is difficult due to non-differentiable interactions with external tools and the high cost of acquiring process-based human supervision. The authors propose a novel method that combines a ReAct-style agent, which interleaves reasoning and action, with a ReST-like self-improvement framework. This framework operates in an iterative loop: a 'grow' phase where the agent generates reasoning trajectories, and an 'improve' phase where a new model is fine-tuned on these trajectories. Crucially, instead of human labels, the system uses AI feedback, employing a large language model to rank and select the best reasoning steps for fine-tuning. This process not only facilitates continuous self-improvement of a large model but also enables self-distillation, transferring the enhanced capabilities to significantly smaller models. The experiments show that after just two iterations, a fine-tuned small model can achieve performance comparable to a much larger teacher model on challenging compositional question-answering benchmarks.",

The core challenge is the complex spatial planning and arrangement of numerous 3D assets. SceneCraft addresses this with a novel dual-loop self-improvement framework. In the inner loop, the agent plans a scene by first creating a relational scene graph, then generates Python code to satisfy the graph's spatial constraints. After rendering the scene, a multimodal vision-language model (GPT-V) acts as a critic, analyzing the rendered image and providing feedback to iteratively refine the script.

Existing methods are often either sample-inefficient (on-policy RL) or struggle with long horizons and complex action spaces (off-policy RL). The authors propose ArCHer, an Actor-Critic framework with a Hierarchical Structure, which decomposes the problem into two levels. A high-level, off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm trains an utterance-level value function, effectively handling long-horizon credit assignment and enabling data reuse. This value function then provides a dense reward signal to a low-level, on-policy policy gradient algorithm that optimizes the token-by-token generation of each utterance. This hybrid approach combines the sample efficiency of off-policy learning with the flexibility of token-level policy optimization. Empirical results on multi-turn tasks like WebShop and dialogue games show that ArCHer achieves up to a 100x improvement in sample efficiency over on-policy methods like PPO and converges to superior performance compared to other off-policy and imitation learning baselines.",

The core problem addressed is that generic reasoning prompts, like the standard \"Let's think step by step\" used in zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT), are not optimal for the diverse range of NLP tasks. The proposed solution is to use an autonomous agent, powered by a more capable LLM like GPT-4, to generate a single set of task-specific instructions for each dataset. This agent leverages web search to gather relevant knowledge about the task and synthesizes it into a step-by-step guide. These instructions are then used to prompt smaller reasoning LLMs (e.g., Llama-2-70b-chat, GPT-3.5 Turbo) for all instances of that task, effectively replacing the generic CoT prompt. The study demonstrates through extensive experiments on 29 datasets that AgentInstruct significantly boosts performance, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on 20 of them.

The authors posit that code acts as a 'wand' for the LLM 'wizard,' providing structure, logic, and executability that natural language lacks. The paper presents a taxonomy of benefits, arguing that code training not only enhances programming skills but also fundamentally unlocks complex reasoning abilities, as seen in Program-of-Thought prompting. A core concept discussed is the 'code-centric paradigm,' where LLMs generate code to serve as a universal interface for invoking external tools, APIs, and even physical robots, enabling scalable and flexible functionality. Furthermore, the executability of code creates a powerful, automated feedback loop; LLMs can generate solutions, test them in a code environment, and use the outcomes for self-correction and improvement.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the poor generalization of open-source LLM-based agents, which tend to overfit to their training environments and fail on unseen tasks. The authors identify that current models memorize observation-action pairs rather than learning to reason and recover from mistakes. To solve this, they propose AgentRefine, a novel framework centered on \"Refinement Tuning\". This involves a two-part data construction process: first, an agent synthesis framework generates diverse environments and tasks from human personas to prevent overfitting. Second, a strong LLM simulates interactions within these environments, generating trajectories that explicitly include errors and subsequent self-refinement steps based on environmental feedback. The model is then fine-tuned on this data, with the loss from erroneous actions masked to prevent learning incorrect reasoning. Experiments across five agent benchmarks show that AgentRefine significantly outperforms existing agent-tuning methods in generalization and robustness to environmental perturbations, establishing a strong correlation between an agent's ability to self-refine and its general problem-solving capabilities.",

Existing defenses like image cropping can disrupt attacks but also degrade performance on clean inputs by distorting semantics. The proposed solution is a novel, training-free defense mechanism based on a multi-agent debate. The framework involves an \"integrated\" agent with access to the full, potentially malicious image, and a \"partial\" agent that sees only a cropped version of the image. These agents debate their interpretations, moderated by a text-only LLM. The core hypothesis is that if the input is clean, the integrated agent will persuade the partial agent; if attacked, the partial agent (unaffected by the attack) will persuade the integrated agent to correct its harmful output. Empirical results on the MM-SafetyBench dataset show this method, particularly using a \"persuasive debate\" format, reduces the average attack success rate from 100% to 22%, outperforming baselines while also maintaining higher response quality and a significantly lower refusal rate.",

SynthFormer solves this by employing a dual-component architecture: a 3D equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) encodes the spatial arrangement of pharmacophores from a reference ligand, and a transformer-based decoder autoregressively generates a corresponding molecule as a synthetic tree. This process predicts a sequence of building blocks and reactions, guaranteeing that the final output is synthetically accessible by construction.

The authors propose a formal classification framework inspired by cognitive science, distinguishing between declarative memory (knowledge within a single task) and procedural memory (skills across multiple tasks).

To operationalize these definitions, the paper introduces a rigorous experimental methodology, centered on calculating a \"context memory border\" for any given environment. This allows researchers to design experiments that unambiguously isolate and test for either STM or LTM capabilities. Empirical results on memory-intensive tasks like Passive-T-Maze validate the framework, demonstrating how improper experimental setup leads to misleading conclusions and how the proposed methodology correctly differentiates the memory capacities of various agent architectures.",

The core of OPTIMA is an iterative 'generate, rank, select, and train' paradigm. This process is guided by a composite reward function that balances task performance, token usage, and communication readability. The framework explores several reinforcement learning algorithms, including iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (iSFT), Direct Preference Optimization (iDPO), and a hybrid iSFT-DPO approach. A key innovation is the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) inspired techniques to generate diverse, high-quality paired data for DPO training by exploring different conversational trajectories. Evaluated on information exchange and complex reasoning tasks with Llama 3 8B, OPTIMA demonstrates substantial improvements over baselines, achieving up to a 2.8x performance gain with less than 10% of the token cost. The results show that optimizing for efficiency can also lead to better inference-time scaling laws, enabling higher performance for a given computational budget.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates how brain-like experience replay can emerge naturally in reinforcement learning agents without being hard-coded. The authors propose a modular RL agent inspired by the brain's prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal formation (HF), modeled as a policy network and a world model, respectively. These modules communicate via a trainable information passage that is only active when the agent is at rest (e.g., after receiving a reward). Trained end-to-end to maximize rewards in a flexible navigation task, the model naturally generates replay sequences in the HF module. The evolution of these replays during adaptation to a new reward location remarkably mirrors patterns observed in rodents. Ablation studies confirm that this emergent replay is functionally critical, improving exploration efficiency. Further analysis reveals that replay serves as a mechanism for the HF to transmit contextual information (like a changed goal) to the PFC, thereby updating the agent's internal value map and future action plans.",

This automated feedback loop is used to generate high-quality data for both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with minimal human intervention. Experiments show that models trained with data from the simulator, like LAM-Sim-8x7B, achieve significant performance gains (e.g., an 18.54% improvement over its base model on ToolEval-Cleaned) and can even enable agentic capabilities in generic LLMs, with one model doubling or tripling its performance.",

When the planner encounters a subgoal requiring affordance knowledge (e.g., what can be used to heat an object), it queries an LLM in a targeted manner. This method is evaluated on the ALFWorld benchmark and a new, more complex dataset called ALFWorld-Afford. Results show that LLM-Regress significantly outperforms baselines like ReAct in success rate (95% vs 70% on ALFWorld), while drastically reducing LLM token usage and planning time, demonstrating a more efficient, reliable, and scalable solution for open-world planning.",

Through experiments on multi-player coordination games and seven reasoning benchmarks (including GSM8k and MMLU), the authors demonstrate that AC significantly outperforms traditional natural language debate.

ToM-agent tackles this by explicitly modeling and tracking a counterpart's Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDIs), crucially disentangling these inferred states from the agent's confidence in them.

This multi-stage process involves action proposal, self-refinement, simulation (predicting state changes as natural language descriptions), and scoring. Experiments on the VisualWebArena and Mind2Web-live benchmarks show that this MPC-based method significantly improves performance over reactive agents, effectively narrowing the performance gap with more complex tree search agents. The work establishes a practical middle ground, enhancing decision-making quality while maintaining the efficiency and safety benefits over methods that require extensive real-world exploration.",

The authors introduce GraphAgent-Reasoner (GAR), a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that employs a multi-agent collaboration strategy. Inspired by distributed graph computation, GAR decomposes a graph problem into smaller, node-centric tasks. Each node in the graph is assigned an agent, and a central Master LLM orchestrates their collaboration. The Master LLM first establishes a distributed algorithm for the given task and then directs the node agents to execute it through iterative communication and state updates. This approach drastically reduces the complexity handled by any single LLM, leading to enhanced accuracy and scalability. Evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset show that GAR achieves near-perfect accuracy on polynomial-time tasks, significantly outperforming existing models.

AOP employs a multi-stage process: it first generates an initial plan via fast, LLM-based decomposition and allocation. This plan is then refined through a series of checks. A trained reward model efficiently evaluates the solvability of each sub-task without costly agent calls. A dedicated 'detector' module assesses the plan's completeness and non-redundancy, providing suggestions for modification. Furthermore, the system uses a repository of 'representative works' (successfully solved tasks) to guide the meta-agent in re-describing or further decomposing ambiguous sub-tasks.

The agent's core innovation is augmenting a classical minimax search algorithm with a Large Language Model (LLM) without any model fine-tuning. PokéChamp leverages the LLM in three key ways: 1) to sample a diverse set of plausible actions, guided by prompts that include output from a dedicated damage calculation tool; 2) to model the opponent's likely moves by combining the LLM's reasoning with historical data from a newly collected dataset of over one million games; and 3) to act as a value function, evaluating the utility of game states at the leaves of the search tree. Empirically, PokéChamp significantly outperforms existing LLM-based agents (76% win rate vs. PokéLLMon) and rule-based bots (84% win rate vs. Abyssal).

This trace is converted into a natural language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and rigorously filtered for correctness and logical coherence. Finally, these high-quality CoTs are used to instruction-tune a base Video-LLM, enhancing its ability to perform multi-step reasoning.

The authors propose a novel framework that leverages human-like communication strategies to guide the learning process. The core idea is to use a \"text-to-mask\" model that maps human-understandable textual descriptions of objects to masks over an agent's observation space. This allows agents to learn *what* to communicate by selecting relevant object features. The framework combines a human-provided strategy (as a rule-based policy or demonstrations) with reinforcement learning. A behavioral cloning loss encourages the communication policy to adhere to the human strategy, while a standard RL objective fine-tunes it for optimal performance. The effectiveness of this hybrid approach is demonstrated on two custom-built MARL tasks, where it learns faster and achieves higher rewards than baselines including no communication, dense communication, and a fixed human-only strategy. The method also offers a degree of interpretability by revealing the context of the agents' messages.",

Existing methods often struggle with speed, interpretability, and high-dimensional data.

The core idea is to fine-tune a pre-trained model on the remaining data (retain set) while interpretably removing the influence of the data to be forgotten (forget set). This is achieved by using an XAI method (LIME) to compute the similarity between forget and retain data, and then re-weighting the loss function's gradients to subtract the forget set's influence. To handle high-dimensional images, a MARL system is introduced where multiple agents with limited observation windows navigate the image, communicating beliefs to collaboratively perform the task. This decomposition reduces dimensionality and speeds up unlearning.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs, which are often subjective and difficult to assess with traditional metrics. The authors propose a novel multi-agent framework inspired by courtroom proceedings, where LLMs assume roles as advocates, judges, and juries. This system facilitates a dynamic, adversarial debate to evaluate competing LLM-generated answers. Two specific architectures are introduced: Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which uses multiple advocates per answer, and Single Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE), which employs an iterative, multi-round debate. The paper provides a theoretical foundation for this approach, drawing from decision theory, legal theory, and psychology, and includes a probabilistic model for error reduction. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench dataset demonstrate that both proposed architectures significantly outperform a standard LLM-as-a-judge baseline. The SAMRE architecture, in particular, shows the highest accuracy gains, suggesting that iterative refinement is a key factor in improving evaluation quality.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of detecting out-of-context (OOC) visual misinformation, where authentic images are paired with misleading text. Existing AI methods often lack generalizability and explainability. The authors introduce MAD-Sherlock, a novel framework that models OOC detection as a debate between multiple large multimodal model (LMM) agents. These agents are augmented with an external information retrieval module that uses reverse image search to gather real-world context. The agents then engage in an asynchronous debate to collaboratively assess the consistency between the image and text, converging on a final decision. This process inherently generates a detailed, human-readable explanation from the debate transcript. Evaluated on NewsCLIPpings, VERITE, and MMFakeBench, MAD-Sherlock achieves new state-of-the-art performance without task-specific fine-tuning.

Evaluated on synthetic user logs and six benchmarks including WebArena, the solution demonstrates 92% forgetting completeness (a 13.6% improvement over baselines), maintains 91% accuracy on retained data, and achieves 98% GDPR compliance, all with a practical overhead of 136ms per request, making it viable for real-world deployment.",

The authors argue that existing benchmarks fail to adequately measure agent capabilities in tasks requiring trial-and-error, or to characterize their behavioral tendencies when faced with conflicting objectives. To solve this, they introduce EconEvals, a suite comprising two novel evaluation types. First, they develop scalable, synthetic benchmarks for three core business tasks: procurement, scheduling, and pricing, which measure objective capability. Second, they propose a new paradigm called \"litmus tests\" to quantify agent tendencies rather than capabilities. These tests measure how agents resolve open-ended tradeoffs, specifically efficiency versus equality, patience versus impatience, and collusiveness versus competitiveness. Experiments on frontier models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o show that while competent at basic tasks, no agent masters the hard benchmarks. The litmus tests successfully differentiate the models' behavioral profiles, revealing tendencies (e.g., GPT-4o's preference for equality) not apparent in standard benchmarks, thus providing a more nuanced tool for assessing LLM agents.",

Existing methods that create emergent communication protocols are often opaque, while forcing human-like language can impair performance. The authors propose a novel framework, Information Gating Multi-Agent (InGaMA), which achieves interpretability by making the *subject* of communication transparent, rather than the message content itself. The core idea is an information gating mechanism where agents learn a separate communication policy to select relevant features from their observation to broadcast. This is enabled by a 'text-to-mask' model that maps human-understandable terms (e.g., 'goal', 'key') to corresponding parts of the observation vector. By communicating a masked version of its observation, an agent reveals *what* it is talking about. Experiments in two custom multi-agent environments demonstrate that InGaMA learns effective, near-optimal policies while producing interpretable communication protocols that reveal sophisticated emergent strategies, such as signaling for help and breaking decision-making deadlocks.",

Current FL strategies often tackle isolated challenges like data heterogeneity or communication efficiency, but struggle with the multifaceted and dynamic nature of practical deployments. The authors advocate for a new paradigm called Agentic Federated Learning (AgenticFL), which employs a multi-agent system of cooperating, task-specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate the entire FL strategy lifecycle. The proposed workflow is inspired by human software development and consists of four stages: Planning, where a planning agent decomposes user requirements; Programming, where coder and debugger agents iteratively generate and validate code; Optimization, where a reflection agent and a committee of reviewer agents self-critique and refine the code; and Deployment, where the final strategy is packaged for a target FL framework.

The authors introduce the concept of 'Federated MAS', distinguishing it from traditional Federated Learning by its focus on real-time collaboration and dynamic communication. To tackle issues like heterogeneous privacy needs and dynamic conversation structures, they propose Embedded Privacy-Enhancing Agents (EPEAgents). This solution acts as a lightweight, server-side middleware that intercepts and filters all data flows. By matching agent roles to specific, pre-labeled data fields in user profiles and intermediate messages, EPEAgents ensure that each agent only receives the minimal information necessary for its sub-task. The authors created a comprehensive synthetic dataset for financial and medical scenarios to evaluate their approach.

Applying this metric to the 'Twenty Questions' benchmark, they find that recent Qwen3 models struggle to update their beliefs coherently, even when provided with high-quality questions. Through counterfactual experiments, the study demonstrates that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on expert trajectories successfully teaches smaller models this belief-updating capability.

    "summary": "The paper addresses the vulnerability of LLM-powered autonomous agents to malicious instructions and attacks, which can lead to severe consequences like privacy breaches. Existing guardrails are insufficient as they fail to handle the complex, sequential, and dynamic nature of agent actions. To solve this, the authors propose SHIELDAGENT, a dedicated guardrail agent that enforces safety policy compliance through verifiable logical reasoning. SHIELDAGENT automatically constructs an Action-based Safety Policy Model (ASPM) by extracting and refining rules from policy documents into probabilistic rule circuits. When a protected agent acts, SHIELDAGENT retrieves relevant rule circuits, generates a verification plan, and uses formal methods to determine if the action is safe, providing a binary label and explanations for violations. To facilitate evaluation, the paper also introduces SHIELDAGENT-BENCH, a comprehensive dataset of agent trajectories with safety violations. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELDAGENT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and rule recall while significantly reducing API queries and inference time.",

Standard measures like the total counterfactual effect (TCFE) quantify the overall impact of an alternative action but fail to explain *how* that effect materializes.

First, they introduce a causal explanation formula that splits the TCFE into two components: the 'total agent-specific effect' (tot-ASE), which captures the effect propagated through the subsequent behaviors of other agents, and the 'reverse state-specific effect' (r-SSE), which captures the effect propagated through the environment's state transitions. Second, they further decompose these components. The tot-ASE is attributed to individual agents using Shapley values, ensuring a fair and efficient allocation of contribution. The r-SSE is attributed to specific state variables using the concept of intrinsic causal contributions, identifying which states were most pivotal. The framework's interpretability is demonstrated in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator, showing it can successfully distinguish and quantify the roles of different agents and environmental dynamics in producing an outcome.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning effective policies in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) from offline preference data, a setting where designing explicit reward functions is difficult. Existing methods often use a two-phase approach—first learning a reward model, then training a policy—which can be unstable and inefficient. The authors introduce O-MAPL, a novel end-to-end framework that bypasses explicit reward modeling. By leveraging the intrinsic link between reward and soft Q-functions within the MaxEnt RL framework, O-MAPL directly learns a global Q-function from pairwise trajectory preferences. To manage the complexity of MARL, it employs a carefully designed value factorization strategy under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, using a linear mixing network to ensure the learning objective remains convex and training is stable. Local policies are then extracted using a weighted behavior cloning approach that guarantees consistency between the global and local optimal policies. Extensive experiments on SMAC and MAMuJoCo benchmarks, using both rule-based and LLM-generated preference data, demonstrate that O-MAPL significantly outperforms existing methods.",

Their analysis reveals that TEE is dominated by extrapolation error, a problem that becomes exponentially worse as the number of agents and the size of the joint action space increase. To address this, the paper proposes a suite of techniques: annealed multi-step bootstrapping to reduce bias from undertrained value networks, averaged Q-targets using an ensemble of estimators to lower variance, and restricted action representation to simplify the target estimation problem.

Second, it translates this plan into executable guardrail code using a predefined toolbox of functions. The deterministic execution of this code allows for reliable enforcement of safety policies. To evaluate their method, the authors introduce two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC for healthcare agent access control and Mind2Web-SC for web agent safety policies.

Standard methods that maximize expected utility are ill-suited for agents who prioritize avoiding catastrophic outcomes. The authors propose a decision-theoretic framework that formalizes the agent's goal as maximizing its value at risk, a quantile of the utility distribution. The core contribution is proving that this complex policy optimization problem is fundamentally equivalent to a simpler, two-stage process: first, designing optimal prediction sets, and second, applying a max-min decision rule that maximizes the worst-case utility within the set. This establishes that prediction sets are a sufficient statistic for risk-averse decision-making. Based on this theory, the paper introduces the Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC) algorithm, a practical, model-agnostic method that constructs these optimal sets and provides distribution-free safety guarantees.

The algorithms achieve near-optimal regret for i.i.d. rewards, significantly improve regret bounds from O(T¹¹/¹²) to O(T²/³) for exploratory agents, and provide the first sublinear regret bound for the linear reward setting, demonstrating substantial theoretical advancements in modeling and solving these complex interactions.",

Prior work has focused on training with partner diversity on a single task, which fails to generalize to new environments. The authors propose a new paradigm, Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), which posits that training on a wide distribution of environments is more effective for learning general cooperative skills than training with a diverse set of partners. To test this, they developed high-performance procedural generators for a toy problem and the Overcooked benchmark, creating billions of unique, solvable coordination challenges. Agents are trained via self-play across these diverse tasks. Experiments show that CEC agents outperform state-of-the-art baselines, which rely on partner diversity, in both AI-AI cross-play on novel tasks and in collaboration with real humans.

Specifically, the LLM is used to perform three key functions: sampling plausible player actions to prune the search tree, modeling the opponent's likely moves to handle partial information, and estimating the value of game states at the search horizon. This framework leverages the LLM's pre-existing knowledge to guide the search effectively.

The principal aims to minimize regret by setting incentives to influence agents' actions over time. The study analyzes two agent response models: a deterministic greedy choice model and a probabilistic smooth choice model. For greedy agents, the authors prove that learning is impossible (linear regret) without prior knowledge of agent preference types. However, when agent response functions are known, they propose an effective algorithm by discretizing the incentive space and reducing the problem to an adversarial linear bandit framework. This approach achieves nearly optimal regret bounds. For the more realistic smooth choice model, where agent decisions are a Lipschitz-continuous function of incentives, the paper develops an algorithm based on discretization and adversarial multi-armed bandits, again providing tight regret bounds that match their derived lower bounds.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the common problem of user-intent misalignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation caused by underspecified prompts. The authors propose a framework for proactive T2I agents that engage in multi-turn dialogue to clarify user needs. The core of the agent is a symbolic \"belief graph\" which represents its understanding and uncertainty about entities, attributes, and relations in the desired image. By calculating uncertainty and importance scores for elements in this graph, the agent strategically asks clarification questions to gather crucial information. User feedback is then used to update the belief graph and refine the prompt for an off-the-shelf T2I model. To evaluate this approach, the paper introduces a scalable, automated evaluation pipeline using a simulated user, alongside a new dataset called DesignBench. Experiments demonstrate that these proactive agents achieve at least a two-fold improvement in VQAScore over standard T2I generation, and human studies show that over 90% of users find the interactive clarification and belief graph features helpful.",

Instead of deploying defenses on every agent, COWPOX operates from a small number of defender-controlled agents. These agents detect attacks by analyzing outputs for malicious content. Upon detecting a virus, a COWPOX agent generates a 'cure sample'—a benign variant of the virus optimized to have a higher retrieval score in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This causes agents to preferentially retrieve and spread the cure instead of the virus, effectively immunizing uninfected agents and recovering infected ones.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) for complex planning in embodied agents, which often operate on resource-constrained, off-the-shelf devices. The authors propose DEDER, a novel framework to distill the reasoning capabilities of a powerful teacher LLM into a smaller, more efficient student policy based on small language models (sLMs). The core idea is to decompose the decision-making process into a two-tier hierarchy: a reasoning-policy and a planning-policy. The reasoning-policy is trained to generate structured rationales by distilling knowledge from an LLM using a specialized dataset constructed via MDP-featured in-context learning and self-verification. To enhance the quality and efficiency of these rationales, DEDER integrates an embodied knowledge graph (KG) to represent environmental context and a contrastively prompted attention model for single-step, multi-rationale generation. The planning-policy then uses these distilled rationales to produce actionable plans. Experiments on the ALFRED benchmark show that DEDER significantly outperforms other language planning and distillation methods, achieving superior zero-shot performance in unseen environments while using a model 2700 times smaller than the best-performing LLM-based baseline.",

The authors propose Entropy-Reinforced Planning (ERP), a novel algorithm that enhances Transformer decoding by integrating an entropy-reinforced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The core innovation is the PH-UCT selection algorithm, which modifies the MCTS search to not only consider the LLM's token probabilities and visit counts but also an 'e-step' forward entropy measurement. This encourages the search to explore regions of high uncertainty where optimal solutions might be hidden. The method uses the LLM's TOP-P/K sampling for efficient expansion and beam search for reward estimation. Experiments on SARS-CoV-2 (3CLPro) and human cancer (RTCB) protein targets show that ERP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 1-10% across multiple drug property metrics.

LAGMA first learns a quantized latent representation of the global state using a modified Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with a novel coverage loss to ensure efficient use of the embedding space. It then identifies and stores high-return, goal-reaching trajectories within this latent space in an extended VQ codebook. During centralized training, LAGMA samples a reference goal-reaching trajectory and provides a theoretically-grounded intrinsic reward to agents for making transitions that follow this path.

The core of SceneCraft is a dual-loop optimization framework.

It leverages a multimodal LLM (GPT-V) to analyze the rendered image, identify misalignments with the text prompt, and iteratively refine the script. The outer loop enables continuous self-improvement through library learning. It analyzes script modifications made across many scenes and consolidates common, effective code patterns into a reusable \"spatial skill\" library, enhancing the agent's capabilities without requiring expensive LLM fine-tuning.

Using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks adapted from cognitive psychology, the authors prompted LLMs and analyzed their behavior by fitting cognitive models, specifically the Rescorla-Wagner model and its variants. The study reveals that LLMs exhibit an asymmetric belief-updating mechanism, demonstrating an 'optimism bias' where they learn more from better-than-expected outcomes than from worse-than-expected ones. This bias is highly dependent on the problem's framing: it reverses for counterfactual feedback about unchosen options and disappears entirely when the LLM is an observer rather than an active agent. These findings are corroborated by training and testing idealized transformer-based agents with meta-reinforcement learning, which display similar behavioral patterns, suggesting that such biases might represent a rational learning strategy.

The authors introduce BAGEL (Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language), a novel method for generating synthetic demonstrations without any human supervision. BAGEL begins with a seed set of either randomly explored trajectories or synthetic instructions. It then uses an iterative round-trip procedure involving two LM components: an LM labeler that generates a natural language instruction for a given action trajectory, and a zero-shot LM agent that attempts to execute that instruction to produce a refined trajectory. This iterative process progressively filters and shapes the initial random interactions into a set of meaningful, language-aligned demonstrations. These generated demonstrations are then used at test time for in-context learning, where relevant examples are retrieved to guide the agent. Experiments on the MiniWob++ and ToolQA benchmarks show that using BAGEL demonstrations improves agent performance by 2-13% absolute and reduces execution failures by up to 13x compared to a zero-shot baseline.",

This framework addresses a gap between empirical MARL, which handles such systems without theoretical guarantees, and theoretical MARL, which often overlooks these specific challenges. In LI-MAMDP, agents' rewards and communication capabilities depend on their distance from one another, defined by a dependence radius and a visibility radius, respectively. The authors propose three closed-form, 'group decentralized' policies—the Amalgam, Cutoff, and First Step Finite Horizon Optimal policies—which are tractable and scalable. The core theoretical contribution is proving that the performance gap between these decentralized policies and the optimal centralized policy diminishes exponentially as the visibility radius increases. This upper bound is shown to be nearly tight by constructing a matching lower bound.

Traditional Control Barrier Function (CBF) methods require complete environmental knowledge, which is often unavailable. To overcome this, the authors propose the Online Exploration-based Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (OE-CLBF) controller. This method learns the environment's safety constraints (the CBF) in real-time by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on local LiDAR sensor data shared among neighboring agents. To mitigate the computational expense of online training, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to identify the most 'important' neighbors, pruning redundant sensor data. This learned, adaptive CBF is integrated into a quadratic programming controller to generate safe actions. The paper provides theoretical safety guarantees for this learning-based approach.

The authors frame this as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem by treating each of the robot's six legs as an independent agent.

This algorithm, based on a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, allows agents to learn a unified policy that simultaneously plans gait, Center of Mass (COM), and foothold sequences. A free gait Transition Feasibility Model (TFM) is used to ensure that all generated motions are kinematically and dynamically valid.

Current agents often plan actions based on an initial world state and then execute them rigidly, leading to failures or inefficiencies, such as trying to clean an already clean plate. The authors propose PRED (Pre-emptive Action Revision by Environmental feeDback), a framework that enables an agent to revise its plan *before* making a mistake. PRED identifies four types of object-related discrepancies between the agent's expectations and its perceptions: object presence, appearance, attributes, and relationships. When a discrepancy is detected by one of four specialized modules (DTA, OHV, APM, ASR), it is converted into a natural language feedback prompt. This prompt, along with the current plan, is fed to a Large Language Model (LLM) which generates a revised, more efficient action sequence. Empirical validation on the TEACh and ALFRED benchmarks, as well as real-robot experiments, shows that PRED significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in success rates and efficiency, demonstrating the value of pre-emptive adaptation.",

CtRL-Sim leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning (RL) by training a multi-agent Transformer model on a large-scale real-world driving dataset (Waymo) processed through a physics-enhanced simulator. The model learns to predict agent actions conditioned on factorized returns-to-go, such as goal achievement and collision avoidance. This design enables intuitive and efficient control at inference time through a technique called exponential tilting, where adjusting coefficients allows users to steer agent behaviors towards or away from specific outcomes (e.g., making them more or less aggressive). Experimental results demonstrate that CtRL-Sim generates realistic and diverse behaviors that are controllable, outperforming baselines in metrics of realism and common sense while being significantly more efficient than competing controllable generation methods.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the limitations of existing algorithms for Mean-Field Games (MFGs), which often rely on impractical assumptions like centralized controllers or oracles. The authors introduce a novel networked communication architecture for decentralized agents learning from a single, non-episodic run of an empirical system. In this framework, agents learn individually and then exchange their policies with neighbors, adopting policies based on their estimated performance. The paper provides theoretical guarantees, proving that the sample complexity of the networked approach is bounded between the superior centralized learning case and the inferior independent learning case. Recognizing that theoretical algorithms are often too slow for practical use, the authors also contribute crucial enhancements, most notably an experience replay buffer, to all three architectures (centralized, independent, and networked). This allows for their first-ever empirical demonstrations. Experiments show that in practical settings with non-ideal hyperparameters, the networked agents significantly outperform independent learners (which barely learn) and often achieve performance comparable to the centralized approach, while being more robust to update failures and dynamic changes in population size.",

The core problem addressed is the limitation of LLMs in performing complex, multi-step (System 2) reasoning. MP provides a single, example-agnostic structural template that guides the model on *how* to think. The authors formalize this concept using category theory, modeling MP as a functor that ensures compositional problem-solving strategies can be systematically decomposed. The framework is extended to Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP), an agentic process where an LLM autonomously generates and refines its own prompts, which is formally modeled as a monad. Experiments show that a Qwen-72B base model using a single meta-prompt achieves state-of-the-art results on MATH (46.3% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4), GSM8K (83.5%), and Game of 24 (100%), demonstrating superior performance and significant token efficiency compared to traditional few-shot methods.",

The study first validates the original findings that larger, more capable models exhibit superior cooperation and that universalization principles enhance sustainable behavior.

First, they investigate resource framing by creating a loss-aversion scenario where agents must eliminate a harmful resource (trash) instead of harvesting a beneficial one (fish). They find that this negative framing dramatically improves cooperation, enabling even smaller models that previously failed to succeed, suggesting LLMs exhibit cognitive biases similar to human loss aversion. Second, they explore heterogeneous agent systems, demonstrating that high-performing models can systematically influence and elevate the cooperative behavior of weaker models through communication. This suggests an emergent leadership dynamic that can enable more resource-efficient multi-agent deployments.

Existing GRD methods are often computationally expensive and assume agents behave optimally, which is unrealistic for humans. The authors propose a novel, data-driven framework that leverages machine learning to overcome these issues. Their approach involves first training a predictive model, a Convolutional Neural Network, to efficiently estimate the 'worst-case distinctiveness' (wcd), a metric for goal inference difficulty. This predictive oracle is then integrated into a gradient-based optimization process that uses Lagrangian relaxation to handle constraints. This allows for scalable and flexible environment design that can account for general, potentially suboptimal, agent behaviors. Through extensive simulations in grid-world and Overcooked-AI environments, the method is shown to outperform traditional approaches in both wcd reduction and runtime efficiency.

The authors propose DecompDpo, a novel preference optimization framework that aligns diffusion models with pharmaceutical requirements. The core innovation is a multi-granularity alignment strategy that decomposes optimization objectives. For properties that are decomposable (e.g., binding affinity), it constructs preference pairs at the substructure level (LocalDPO); for non-decomposable properties (e.g., drug-likeness), it uses full-molecule preferences (GlobalDPO). This dual approach offers greater flexibility and efficiency. To ensure generated molecules are physically plausible, DecompDpo incorporates a physics-informed energy term that penalizes unrealistic conformations. Evaluated on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, the method demonstrates significant improvements for both general molecule generation and targeted optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results in binding affinity and success rates while maintaining structural validity.",

RePrompt operates like a machine learning training loop: an 'Actor' LLM uses the current prompt to interact with a task and generate a chat history, which includes feedback from mechanisms like ReAct or Reflexion. A 'Summarizer' LLM then analyzes a batch of these histories to identify recurring problems or effective strategies, effectively acting as a loss function. Finally, a 'Prompt Optimizer' LLM updates the step-by-step instructions in the prompt based on this summary, akin to a gradient update.

GMAgent first deploys multiple GNNs as efficient graph agents to identify \"conflict scenarios\" where their predictions diverge. For these difficult cases, the framework repurposes fine-tuned LLMs as specialized graph agents with distinct roles. A graph-oriented collaboration process is then initiated, where an advanced LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) acts as a moderator, generating summary reports and confidence scores to guide a collaborative self-reflection among the LLM agents. This process refines their analyses until a consensus is reached, leading to a final answer that integrates insights from all agents.

The authors address the gap in understanding how LLMs perform in complex supply chain scenarios with multiple sources of uncertainty, such as stochastic demand and lead times. AIM-Bench consists of five distinct inventory management environments, ranging from the single-period Newsvendor Problem to multi-agent Supply Chain Networks.

The authors introduce DSM5AgentFlow, a multi-agent LLM workflow designed to automate and explain the diagnostic process based on the DSM-5 Level-1 questionnaire. The system comprises three agents: a therapist agent that conducts a conversational interview, a client agent that simulates patient responses based on a predefined profile, and a diagnostician agent. After the dialogue, the diagnostician agent uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant DSM-5 criteria, predicts a disorder, and generates a transparent, step-by-step rationale that explicitly links the client's statements to diagnostic criteria. Through experiments with four LLMs on 8,000 simulated conversations, the study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. It reveals a trade-off where reasoning-optimized models (like Qwen-QWQ) achieve superior diagnostic accuracy and explainability, while conversation-focused models produce higher-quality dialogues.

The authors propose a novel proactive replanning framework that preemptively identifies and mitigates potential failures. The core of their method is a lightweight, scene graph-based failure anticipation system. Before executing each sub-task, the agent constructs a 3D scene graph from its current RGB-D observation, capturing objects, states, and their spatial relationships. This graph is then compared against a buffer of expected scene graphs derived from successful reference demonstrations. If the structural similarity falls below a predefined threshold, the system triggers replanning. An LLM (GPT-4o) is then prompted with the detected discrepancies to reason about the cause of the potential failure and generate a corrective action sequence. Experiments conducted in the AI2-THOR simulator on the RoboFail dataset show that this proactive approach significantly outperforms reactive, post-hoc baselines in both failure detection and overall task success rates, while also producing higher-quality failure explanations as validated by human evaluators.",

To solve this, the paper formulates the problem as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching task. It proposes a multi-layered optimization framework to first maximize social welfare for given capacities, then find the optimal distribution of a total fixed capacity to minimize the welfare gap, and finally, balance welfare gains with the practical costs of reallocating capacities.

The authors argue that static analysis is insufficient for discovering these dynamic, multi-turn attack vectors. To tackle this, they propose a search-based framework that uses simulation to model adversarial agent interactions. The framework sets up a scenario with an attacker (data recipient) and a defender (data sender) and uses an LLM as an optimizer to iteratively refine their respective instructions in an alternating fashion. This adversarial co-evolution is enhanced by a parallel search algorithm with cross-thread propagation to efficiently explore the vast space of strategies. The research demonstrates that this process uncovers an escalation of attacks, from simple requests to sophisticated multi-turn impersonation and consent forgery, which in turn drives the development of robust defenses like identity-verification state machines.

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is trained to optimize five key Keplerian orbital elements to maximize terrestrial target coverage while adhering to safety and altitude constraints. The agent is guided by a comprehensive, multi-objective reward function and a custom callback mechanism that prevents training stagnation by forcing exploration.

Two novel methods are introduced to allocate this budget dynamically: HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm that prioritizes agents with the best improvement-to-divergence ratio, and HATRPO-W, a principled optimization method based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and a water-filling analogy. Extensive experiments on matrix games, differential games, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that these adaptive allocation strategies significantly outperform the original HATRPO.

Existing agents often use inefficient, serial, natural-language tool calls that disrupt multi-step inference.

The planner agent focuses on high-level strategy, decomposing tasks and reasoning over structured information, which keeps its context clean. The executor agent handles the low-level, high-volume interactions with the web, using programmatic tool invocation (Python code) and a set of standardized primitives (e.g., batch_search, check_condition) for efficient, parallel information gathering. This separation allows for scalable web exploration without compromising reasoning depth.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the issue of 'cognitive load interference' in single-agent systems for mathematical problem-solving, where a single large language model must simultaneously handle high-level reasoning and low-level code generation. The authors empirically demonstrate that this integrated approach impairs the agent's ability to generate correct reasoning paths, especially on difficult problems. To mitigate this, they propose a dual-agent hybrid framework that decouples these roles. A 'Reasoning Agent' decomposes problems into logical steps, while a 'Code Agent' generates and executes Python code for computational sub-problems. The training methodology combines imitation learning with a dual-channel reinforcement learning scheme. The Code Agent is rewarded for correct intermediate code, and the Reasoning Agent is optimized based on final answer accuracy using advantage estimation for credit assignment. Preliminary results, even without the full reinforcement learning phase, show that this decoupled design outperforms a single-agent baseline, supporting the hypothesis that separating cognitive functions leads to more stable and effective problem-solving.",

Existing methods often use fixed retrieval pipelines or iterative planning, leading to redundant searches, high latency, and suboptimal performance.

This approach eliminates redundant operations and error propagation. To rigorously evaluate such systems, the paper also introduces the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark, the first of its kind, featuring diverse question types, expert-validated plans, and a hierarchical evaluation metric that assesses planning accuracy independently of final answer quality.

    "summary": "This research paper addresses the inadequacy of traditional security frameworks like STRIDE and PASTA for securing modern agentic AI systems. The authors argue that the unique characteristics of agents—such as autonomous reasoning, memory, and tool interaction—create a complex threat surface that these older models cannot capture. To solve this, the paper applies the MAESTRO framework, a seven-layer model for threat analysis, to a custom-built, LLM-based network monitoring agent. The framework helps map and localize threats across layers, from the foundation model to the agent ecosystem. A quantitative risk scoring model (Risk = Likelihood × Impact × Exploitability) is introduced to prioritize these threats. The study's findings are validated through two practical experiments: a resource exhaustion attack (simulated DoS) and a memory poisoning attack. The results demonstrate the agent's vulnerability, showing performance degradation under network load and flawed decision-making from corrupted memory, thus confirming the framework's utility in identifying and analyzing cross-layer security risks. The paper concludes by proposing a defense-in-depth strategy with mitigation measures tailored to each MAESTRO layer.",

Current defense methods are often supervised, requiring labeled data of specific attacks, which is impractical for real-world deployment where attacks are diverse and data is scarce. The authors propose BlindGuard, a novel unsupervised defense framework that can safeguard MAS without any prior knowledge of attack patterns or labeled malicious agents. BlindGuard models the MAS as a graph and employs a two-pronged approach. First, a hierarchical agent encoder captures multi-level context by integrating individual agent features, local neighborhood information, and global system dynamics. Second, a corruption-guided attack detector is trained on only normal interaction data. It simulates malicious behavior by corrupting agent feature embeddings and uses a supervised contrastive learning objective to distinguish these synthetic anomalies from normal agents. During inference, agents deviating from the learned normal patterns are identified and isolated via edge pruning. Extensive experiments across four topologies, three attack types, and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that BlindGuard significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods and achieves performance competitive with supervised approaches, proving its practicality and robustness for real-world MAS security.",

    "summary": "The paper addresses the critical scarcity of high-quality, realistic data for training machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) systems. Existing datasets are often synthetic, lacking semantic richness and realistic behavioral patterns, while real enterprise data is inaccessible due to privacy concerns. To solve this, the authors propose Chimera, a novel multi-agent framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically simulate both benign and malicious insider activities in diverse corporate settings. Chimera customizes LLM agents to represent individual employees with specific roles and personalities, enabling them to perform daily tasks, communicate, and interact within a simulated enterprise. The framework integrates 15 distinct types of insider attacks, allowing malicious agents to conduct threats while maintaining their regular work routines. The result is ChimeraLog, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset generated from simulations in technology, finance, and medical organizations. Human studies and quantitative analyses confirm the dataset's realism and complexity, showing it is significantly more challenging for existing ITD methods than standard benchmarks like CERT, thereby highlighting the need for more robust detection techniques.",

It argues that an agent's actions, whether from a binary classifier or a continuous controller, implicitly reveal the ethical trade-offs made by its designers, which are often incommensurable and unobservable to the user. The proposed solution, \"Ethics2vec,\" is a quantitative framework to reverse-engineer and represent these ethical values as a vector. The method assumes the agent's strategy is optimal for a weighted sum of costs or risks. For binary classification, it demonstrates that the ratio of false positive to false negative costs can be derived from the slope of the ROC curve at the agent's operating point. This concept is extended to continuous control agents, like self-driving cars, by defining an ethical vector based on the derivatives of various risk functions (e.g., accident risk vs. risk of being late) with respect to the control action. Simulated experiments for both cases show that the method can successfully map different agent strategies to distinct points in an \"ethical space,\" allowing for quantitative comparison and assessment of alignment with human values.",

The authors propose a multi-agent reasoning framework called \"1-2-3 Check\" that decomposes the task into specialized roles: an Extractor agent identifies events, a Checker agent validates and classifies them as public or private, and an Executor agent generates the final, privacy-aware output. The research systematically investigates how different information flow strategies between these agents—such as forwarding only public content versus forwarding all content with privacy annotations—impact performance. Evaluated on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmarks, the multi-agent approach significantly reduces secret leakage by 18-19% compared to single-agent baselines, while maintaining the fidelity of public information.

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive survey of self-evolving AI agents, an emerging paradigm aimed at overcoming the limitations of static, manually configured agent systems. The authors argue that most current agents cannot adapt to dynamic environments post-deployment. To address this, they introduce the concept of Multi-Agent Self-Evolving (MASE) systems, framing it as the culmination of a four-stage evolution from static model pretraining (MOP) to autonomous, lifelong learning. The survey proposes a unified conceptual framework abstracting the agent evolution feedback loop into four components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers. Using this framework, the paper systematically reviews a wide array of optimization techniques for single-agent systems (targeting prompts, memory, tools, LLM behavior) and multi-agent systems (targeting topology, prompts, and unified co-evolution). It also covers domain-specific evolution in fields like biomedicine and programming, discusses evaluation and safety, and proposes \"Three Laws of Self-Evolving AI Agents\" (Endure, Excel, Evolve) to guide safe and effective development.",

The authors propose a novel framework that integrates LLM-based agents into the causal machine learning pipeline to automate confounder discovery and subgroup analysis.

In each iteration, an LLM agent, augmented with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and decomposed prompting, analyzes decision rules from a causal tree to hypothesize potential confounders.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the multi-agent credit assignment problem in cooperative reinforcement learning, where it is difficult to determine each agent's contribution to a shared reward. The authors propose a novel multi-level credit assignment formulation inspired by human collaboration, which considers that agents can contribute through various overlapping subgroups. Based on this, they introduce MACA (Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment), an actor-critic method. MACA constructs a multi-level counterfactual advantage function by combining three distinct advantage baselines: one for individual contributions (like COMA), one for the joint contribution of all agents (like MAPPO), and a novel one for the contribution of a dynamically identified subset of strongly correlated agents. The correlation is determined using the attention mechanism of a transformer encoder. Experiments on the challenging SMAC and SMACv2 benchmarks show that MACA significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and sample efficiency, especially in complex and stochastic environments. Ablation studies confirm that each component of the multi-level advantage is crucial to its success.",

The core problem is to enable cooperative pathfinding for multiple robots (agents) while considering realistic wireless communication constraints, a challenge in environments like automated warehouses. The proposed solution, PANAMA, uses a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. Its key innovations include an asymmetric observation space and a dynamic priority system based on A* distance to the goal, which forces agents to yield to higher-priority agents, effectively breaking symmetry and preventing deadlocks. Furthermore, the framework integrates a model of the network (D-Net) by including a normalized SINR map in each agent's observation and adding a penalty to the reward function for traversing areas with poor signal quality. Experiments show that PANAMA not only learns cooperative strategies efficiently but also scales effectively, outperforming the LaCAM* benchmark in scenarios with up to 256 agents. The network-aware version successfully demonstrates a trade-off, accepting longer paths (increased makespan) to maintain superior communication quality and avoid connection blackouts.",

The author introduces ScamAgent, a modular, autonomous agent framework that simulates human-level scam calls by integrating LLMs with goal-driven planning, contextual memory, and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of creating effective multi-agent systems for complex medical multimodal decision-making, particularly using open-source models. Existing systems are often limited to language-only tasks or rely on expensive proprietary models, while naively combining vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify errors due to their limited self-reflection capabilities. The authors propose MedOrch, a novel mediator-guided collaboration framework. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that uses Socratic questioning to orchestrate interaction and reflection among multiple heterogeneous, open-source VLM-based expert agents. This process involves an initial response generation by experts, followed by a guided dialogue where the mediator identifies conflicts and prompts deeper reasoning. A final judge agent synthesizes the entire conversation to produce a concluding decision. Evaluated on five medical vision question answering (VQA) benchmarks, MedOrch demonstrates superior performance, outperforming not only individual agents but also alternative multi-agent strategies, all without any model training. The results highlight the potential of structured collaboration among diverse open-source models to create powerful and cost-effective AI for medical applications.",

The systematic evaluation of nine different LLMs reveals a severe degradation in performance when moving from explicit instructions to constraint-based reasoning. Success rates drop from over 85% on simple commands to below 65% for tasks requiring tool use or implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing failure rates exceeding 50%.

This approach enables a granular evaluation of both intermediate reasoning steps and the final output. Evaluated on the GAIA and BigCodeBench datasets, the Auto-Eval Judge framework achieved significantly higher alignment with human judgments (4.76% and 10.52% improvement, respectively) compared to a strong GPT-4o LLM-as-a-Judge baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses a critical gap in AI alignment research, which often overlooks the pluralism of human values by treating geographic and cultural variations as noise. This can lead to agentic AI systems producing outputs that are locally inappropriate, culturally insensitive, or illegal. The authors introduce the concept of \"geo-alignment,\" a framework for ensuring AI behavior aligns with geographically and temporally dependent norms, values, and goals. They argue that unlike other abstract dimensions of pluralism, spatial structure is a predictable and learnable pattern. The paper proposes a formalization for geo-alignment by measuring the dissimilarity between an AI's output distribution and the ideal locally appropriate distribution for a given query and context. As a vision paper, it outlines a research agenda, suggesting the development of geo-aware benchmarks and exploring methods like neuro-symbolic AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with geo-knowledge graphs to make geo-alignment practical for autonomous agents acting in the real world.",

To address this ambiguity, the author proposes a new, structured framework for defining AI agents. The proposed solution first establishes three minimum criteria for a system to be considered an agent: having a measurable environmental impact, exhibiting goal-directed behavior, and maintaining state awareness. Systems that meet this threshold can then be evaluated on their degree of 'agenticness'—a term introduced to avoid the philosophical weight of 'agency'—across a five-dimensional spectrum. These dimensions are: environmental interaction sophistication, goal complexity and management, temporal coherence, learning and adaptation, and autonomy.

They then enhance the communication structure and compare a non-reasoning model (GPT-4o) with a strong-reasoning model (o3). The results reveal a key trade-off: the reasoning model demonstrates superior planning and team orchestration but introduces more diverse and complex failure patterns due to its initiative.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of enabling effective collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). Current approaches that rely on prompt-level coordination are often inefficient and unreliable, while independent fine-tuning lacks convergence guarantees. The authors propose modeling LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem, formalized as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP). They introduce a novel algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), which facilitates joint optimization through centralized group-relative advantage estimates while preserving scalable decentralized execution. This method avoids the need for large, complex centralized value models. Experiments conducted on collaborative writing and coding tasks demonstrate that fine-tuning with MAGRPO significantly improves both the quality and efficiency of the joint outputs compared to single-agent and prompt-based multi-agent baselines. The trained agents are shown to develop diverse and effective cooperation schemes without complex reward engineering, highlighting the potential of MARL for building robust multi-LLM systems.",

The authors propose TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent), a novel three-stage agentic framework for AI search. TURA first employs an Intent-Aware Tool Retrieval module to decompose complex queries into atomic sub-intents and retrieve relevant tools (APIs or documents) from a semantically-indexed catalogue. Next, a DAG-based Task Planner constructs an optimal, parallelizable execution plan, modeling sub-tasks and their dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph to minimize latency. Finally, a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor, fine-tuned on curated expert trajectories using a \"train-with-thought, infer-without-thought\" paradigm, executes the plan with high fidelity and low latency. Deployed in a large-scale production environment, TURA demonstrated significant improvements over a strong RAG baseline, boosting answer accuracy from 65.3% to 87.5% in offline tests and increasing the online Session Success Rate by 8.9%, proving its effectiveness as a production-ready solution for next-generation AI search.",

The authors propose D2Snap, a novel downsampling algorithm that reduces the size of a DOM while preserving its essential UI features. D2Snap operates by consolidating container elements to retain hierarchy, converting content elements to compact Markdown, and filtering attributes based on their semantic importance, which is rated by an LLM.

An agent using these downsampled DOMs achieves a task success rate (67-73%) that meets or exceeds the baseline of grounded GUI snapshots (65%), while significantly reducing input data size.

The agent dynamically decides whether to use its internal knowledge or to leverage external retrieval tools (like Wikipedia and Google Search). Through a self-reflection mechanism, it assesses the quality of retrieved information and plans subsequent actions, such as escalating to a more advanced search tool or synthesizing the final answer. Experiments on standard KGC datasets and a newly constructed 'Emerging-Entities' dataset show that AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods, with improvements of up to 45.3% on emerging entities.

It addresses the common LLM struggles with spatial consistency, multi-hop inference, and geographic bias.

This process explicitly embeds geographic principles, such as Tobler's First Law, by leveraging predictions from nearby locations and relevant environmental covariates to refine an initial guess. Through comprehensive experiments on four geospatial tasks (infant mortality, GDP, temperature, precipitation) and across various LLMs, the study demonstrates that GeoSR significantly improves prediction accuracy, as measured by Spearman correlation, and substantially reduces geographic bias, thereby promoting more equitable and spatially aware outputs.",

    "summary": "This research addresses the unreliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a neurosymbolic layer inspired by the software engineering paradigm of Design by Contract (DbC). The paper formalizes an agent as a tuple comprising models, instructions, hyperparameters, types, and contracts. The core of the solution is a validation and remediation pipeline that wraps LLM calls. It uses type theory to define structured data specifications and enforces contracts through pre-conditions (checked before execution) and post-conditions (checked on the output). If a contract is violated, an automated remediation process iteratively re-prompts the LLM with error feedback to guide it toward a compliant output. This approach introduces a probabilistic notion of contract satisfaction, P_succ, allowing for quantitative comparison of agent reliability and cost. The system is designed for resilience, with a fallback mechanism to ensure graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure, thus bridging formal verification principles with the probabilistic nature of modern generative agents.",

The authors demonstrate that naive recovery strategies can lead to deadlocks and that centrally recomputing an optimal schedule to absorb a delay without increasing the makespan is NP-hard. To overcome these challenges, the work proposes two decentralized, local recovery protocols. The first, \"Check Before Moving\" (CBM), handles a single agent malfunction by giving priority to the delayed agent, provably increasing the total makespan by only one, which is optimal in the worst case. The second, \"Check Counter Before Moving\" (CCBM), extends this to handle up to k malfunctions. It uses vertex-based counters to track agent traversals, allowing agents to locally decide when to pause.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of agent modeling in multi-agent systems, where an agent must infer the policies of other agents to make optimal decisions, particularly when direct information about others is unavailable at execution time. The authors propose Transformer-Based Agent Modeling (TransAM), an architecture that frames agent modeling as a sequence modeling task. TransAM uses a transformer encoder to process the controlled agent's own local trajectory (a sequence of its past rewards, actions, and observations) into a latent embedding. This embedding, which captures the influence of other agents' policies, is then used to condition the controlled agent's policy. The model is trained jointly with an A2C reinforcement learning algorithm, using an auxiliary generative loss to reconstruct the other agents' trajectories from the learned embedding. This approach eliminates the need for other agents' data at inference time. Experiments across cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive environments show that TransAM outperforms several baselines in episodic returns, often matching or exceeding an Oracle with full information, and achieves a strong balance between agent modeling accuracy and task performance.",

The clinical similarity between the reports is then quantified by the agreement in their answers. This produces two interpretable scores: ICARE-GT, a proxy for precision that measures the preservation of key findings, and ICARE-GEN, a proxy for recall that assesses the consistency of new information. Human studies with board-certified radiologists confirmed that ICARE aligns more closely with expert judgment than prior metrics.

Existing systems often fail to monitor execution and self-correct when errors occur. The authors introduce HyCodePolicy, a closed-loop control framework that treats generated code as an evolving hypothesis. Given a language instruction, HyCodePolicy first decomposes it into sub-goals and synthesizes an initial program grounded in geometric primitives. During simulated execution, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) monitors the agent at designated checkpoints. If a failure is detected, the system fuses symbolic execution logs with the VLM's perceptual feedback to diagnose the root cause. This hybrid diagnosis guides a targeted repair of the code, which is then re-executed. This iterative cycle of synthesis, monitoring, and repair enables the agent to autonomously refine its policy. Experimental results show that HyCodePolicy significantly improves task success rates (e.g., from 62.1% to 71.3% in one setting) and reduces the number of iterations needed to converge on a successful policy, demonstrating a more robust and efficient approach to autonomous decision-making.",

Existing leader-selection mechanisms like fixed alternation are sub-optimal and fail to prevent defection in episodic settings. The authors propose introducing a central, trusted \"fair Markov mediator\" to dynamically select leaders with the explicit goal of maximizing system-wide fairness. Their proposed framework, Joint Agents-Mediator Q-learning (JAM-QL), incentivizes agents to act fairly by making future leadership opportunities contingent on past fair behavior and by introducing an end-of-episode mechanism to penalize terminal-state defection. Theoretical analysis proves convergence to an optimally fair equilibrium under certain conditions. Empirical results on iterated matrix games and resource collection tasks show that the mediator-integrated framework leads to the emergence of fair leaders and achieves significantly higher fairness compared to baselines like fixed, alternating, or vote-based leader selection.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a novel and stealthy threat to Large Language Model (LLM) agents that utilize external tools. Instead of relying on traditional prompt injection or manipulating tool outputs, AMA exploits the agent's tool selection process by crafting highly appealing metadata (e.g., name, description, parameters) for a malicious tool. The authors formalize the generation of this deceptive metadata as a state-action-value optimization problem, which is solved using an LLM's in-context learning capabilities. This optimization is accelerated by three mechanisms: generation traceability, weighted value evaluation, and batch generation. Extensive experiments across four mainstream LLM agents and ten task scenarios demonstrate that AMA achieves attack success rates between 81% and 95%. The attack proves highly effective at causing privacy leakage with minimal disruption to the primary task and successfully bypasses existing prompt-level defenses and structured protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), revealing a systemic vulnerability in current agent architectures.",

The system was evaluated on the task of predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence from EHR data of 147 patients. Results show that SNOW achieves predictive performance statistically comparable to the manual CFG gold standard (AUC 0.761 vs. 0.771). Both methods significantly outperformed a baseline model and 14 different RFG approaches, which failed to improve predictive power in this small-sample setting. SNOW thus presents a scalable, interpretable, and high-performing solution that bridges the gap between manual clinical expertise and automated AI systems.",

A key innovation is the capture of not just the agents' actions but also their natural language explanations, enabling direct analysis of their reasoning processes. By instantiating models from the GPT, Claude, and Gemini families in a zero-shot tournament, the study reveals that LLMs can emulate sophisticated human-like strategies, such as team balancing and opponent modeling. The results highlight a diversity in strategic approaches, with one model achieving victory through a high-risk, high-reward strategy of using powerful legendary Pokémon, outperforming more conventional, balanced teams.",

The framework addresses the \"Garbage-In, Garbage-Out\" problem, where models trained on flawed data produce unreliable outputs. The proposed solution features a two-tiered agent system: External Agent 1, a real-time evaluator, identifies suboptimal model decisions and populates a 'Rejected Data Pipeline'. External Agent 2 then curates this pipeline, selecting only business-relevant, valid scenarios for augmentation and retraining. This creates a continuous feedback loop that refines the model's performance over time. The framework's efficacy was demonstrated on a real-world task of identifying and extracting information from Indian identity documents using a YOLOv8 model.

Each MAV agent learns a policy that operates independently without any inter-agent communication, using only its own state, the load's pose, and the target pose as input. A key innovation is the action space design, where the policy outputs reference linear accelerations and body rates (ACCBR), which are tracked by a robust low-level controller to bridge the sim-to-real gap.

Existing methods are either too computationally expensive and unscalable (like KDN) or overly conservative, leading to inefficient agent movement (like ADG). The authors propose WinkTPG, an execution framework that builds upon a novel planner, kTPG. kTPG transforms the passing order constraints from a Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) into reserved time intervals for each agent at specific locations. It then generates kinodynamically feasible speed profiles for each agent independently to satisfy these intervals. To handle uncertainty, a safety margin mechanism is introduced. WinkTPG further enhances robustness and efficiency by employing a windowed replanning mechanism that periodically incorporates real-time agent location data to reduce accumulated uncertainty. Empirical results show that WinkTPG significantly improves solution quality by up to 51.7% compared to ADG and is highly scalable, generating plans for 1,000 agents in under a second, a feat unachievable by optimization-based methods like KDN.",

Second, a list-based text encoding strategy uses these multiple, diverse descriptions instead of a single prompt to better align with visual features from WSIs. This approach is integrated into a vision-language Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline using the CONCH encoder.

The agent accepts multimodal inputs like text and sketches, engages in interactive dialogue to refine design requirements, and utilizes a suite of tools for analysis, code generation, execution, and verification. A key contribution is the novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), a method for structuring CAD modeling code that decouples operations, provides LLM-friendly error messages, and uses explicit type annotations. This paradigm, combined with a vision-based feedback loop for iterative correction, allows the agent to generate high-fidelity CAD models. Experimental results show that CADDesigner surpasses other learning-based and agent-based methods in geometric accuracy and demonstrates superior code generation success rates.",

The authors propose a novel agentic RAG framework where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as autonomous agents to improve diagnostic accuracy. The framework uses a multi-agent architecture with a 'supervisor' agent that decomposes clinical questions and delegates sub-tasks to 'research' agents. These agents iteratively search the Radiopaedia.org knowledge base, retrieve targeted evidence for each possible diagnosis, and synthesize a structured, evidence-based report. This report is then used by the final LLM to select the most likely diagnosis. The study benchmarks 24 diverse LLMs on a 104-question dataset, comparing the agentic approach to zero-shot prompting and conventional RAG. Results show that the agentic framework significantly improves mean diagnostic accuracy (73%) over both baselines (64% and 68%, respectively).

    "summary": "This paper introduces Pro2Guard, a framework for proactively enforcing the safety of LLM-powered agents. The core problem is that many existing safety mechanisms are reactive, intervening only when a harmful action is imminent or has already occurred. Pro2Guard addresses this by modeling an agent's stochastic behavior as a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) over a set of abstract, symbolic states. The framework first collects agent execution traces, abstracts them using domain-specific predicates, and learns the probabilistic transitions of the DTMC. At runtime, it uses probabilistic model checking to calculate the probability of the agent reaching a predefined unsafe state in the future. If this risk exceeds a configurable threshold, Pro2Guard triggers a proactive intervention, such as halting the agent or prompting for self-reflection. Evaluations in embodied household robotics and autonomous driving demonstrate that Pro2Guard effectively reduces safety violations—enforcing safety on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks—while allowing a configurable balance between safety and task completion. The method achieves this with a low runtime overhead by caching inference results.",

MetaAgent addresses this by starting with a minimal workflow of autonomous reasoning and adaptive help-seeking, where it delegates tool use to a dedicated router. The core innovation is \"meta tool learning,\" a process where the agent continually improves without parameter updates. After each task, MetaAgent engages in self-reflection and verified reflection to distill successful strategies and identify pitfalls. These learnings are dynamically incorporated into its context for future tasks. It also builds a persistent \"in-house\" knowledge base from its tool interactions to gain a more holistic view of information. Experiments on challenging benchmarks like GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp show that MetaAgent outperforms expert-designed baselines and achieves performance competitive with or superior to end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating a robust and generalizable approach to agent evolution.",

Current agents often fail at complex tasks due to their linear, step-by-step reasoning. SimuRA addresses this by incorporating an LLM-based world model to perform simulative reasoning. The architecture consists of three main modules: a policy module that proposes potential actions, a world model that simulates the outcomes of these actions in a natural language latent space, and a critic module that evaluates the simulated outcomes to select the best action. This mimics human-like planning by imagining and evaluating possibilities before acting. The paper demonstrates SimuRA's effectiveness on a range of challenging web browsing tasks, showing substantial improvements over baselines.

The problem is that traditional trust evaluation is resource-intensive and often inefficient in dynamic environments. The proposed solution leverages agentic AI and hypergraphs. A multi-agent system, with specialized agents for tasks like state perception, data collection, and evaluation, autonomously performs trust assessments during device idle periods to minimize interference with primary tasks.

The authors propose a novel framework that integrates a Blockchain-based Trust Management Mechanism (BTMM) with a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach. The BTMM establishes a decentralized system to evaluate UAV trustworthiness based on delivery rate and path correctness, using an enhanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus to isolate malicious nodes. For routing, the problem is formulated as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where each UAV acts as an agent. A Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (MADDQN) is then used to enable these agents to learn optimal, collaborative routing policies that minimize total end-to-end delay despite the network's dynamic topology and partial observability. Simulation results validate the proposed BTMM-MADDQN algorithm, showing it outperforms baselines like BTMM-MAPPO and BTMM-MADQN in delay, throughput, and convergence.

Experiments on the ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks demonstrate that RLVMR achieves new state-of-the-art results, with a 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on the most difficult unseen tasks.

Existing paradigms like Centralized Training/Decentralized Execution (CTDE) suffer from non-stationarity, while Centralized Training/Centralized Execution (CTCE) schemes face an exponentially growing joint-action space. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a novel CTCE algorithm. TAAC incorporates a multi-headed attention mechanism directly into the actor network, enabling agents to model an information-sharing “conversation” and dynamically query teammates during decision-making. This allows for scalable management of the joint-action space. Additionally, a novel “conformity loss” is introduced to encourage agents to learn diverse yet complementary roles. The algorithm was evaluated in a simulated 3v3 soccer environment, a complex testbed for teamwork. TAAC was benchmarked against PPO (a DTDE method) and MAAC (a CTDE method). Results show that TAAC significantly outperformed both baselines in performance metrics like win rate and Elo rating, and also demonstrated superior coordinated teamwork based on collaboration metrics such as agent connectivity and possession swaps.",

The authors propose a multi-agent intelligent triage system designed for collaborative, dynamic matching of patients to appropriate medical departments.

Results show that the multi-round interactive process significantly improves accuracy, with overall triage accuracy rising from 66.5% to 74.2%.

This evolving emotional state then guides the agent's decision-making process. Experiments on generative tasks show that SE improves LLM performance.

    "summary": "This paper introduces UI-AGILE, a framework to improve Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents by addressing critical limitations in both training and inference. Existing agents struggle with a trade-off between reasoning and grounding accuracy, ineffective binary rewards leading to imprecise actions, and performance degradation from visual noise on high-resolution screens. UI-AGILE's solution includes three key training enhancements: a \"Simple Thinking\" reward to encourage moderately complex reasoning, a continuous grounding reward based on distance to the target's center for precise localization, and a cropping-based resampling method to dynamically simplify difficult tasks and avoid sparse reward issues. For inference, it proposes a \"decomposed grounding with selection\" method that splits large screenshots into smaller parts, generates candidate actions on each, and uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the best one. Experiments show that UI-AGILE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on grounding and general agent benchmarks, even when using smaller models and a fraction of the training data. The inference technique also acts as a plug-and-play enhancement for other existing agents.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the limitations of traditional, static business process (BP) models in dynamic environments. It introduces a new paradigm for BP development centered on agentic AI. The proposed approach shifts from a task-based to a goal-driven model, where BPs are not defined by fixed workflows but by a collection of business goals, information objects, and autonomous agents responsible for achieving them. The authors formalize this concept, defining an agent as a tuple comprising its identifier, capabilities (CRUDA operations), trigger objects, resource objects, final objects, and its specific goal. A complete Agent-based Business Process (ABP) is then defined as a system of start/end objects, resources, goals, capabilities, and agents. This declarative model, focusing on 'what' (goals) rather than 'how' (tasks), allows workflows to emerge dynamically from agent interactions, enabling greater flexibility and adaptability for real-time business scenarios. The paper also acknowledges the significant challenges in safety, ethics, and governance that accompany the deployment of such autonomous systems.",

The authors define agentic hallucination as actions that are unfaithful to the agent's context, which they categorize into three types: unfaithfulness to task instructions, interaction history, or environment observations. To systematically elicit these failures, the work identifies six recurring \"risk settings\" (e.g., unachievable goals, unexpected environment transitions) from existing agent benchmarks. The core innovation is a \"contextual snapshot\" strategy that freezes an agent's state at a critical decision point, creating deterministic and reproducible test cases. Evaluation is performed scalably using a fine-grained LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with risk-aware prompts to assess the faithfulness of an agent's next action. Empirical results on twelve prominent LLMs show that hallucination is a persistent problem even for state-of-the-art models, with proprietary models showing only a modest lead over open-source ones. The findings highlight common failure patterns, such as fabricating UI elements or assuming unverified success, and provide a critical tool for diagnosing and mitigating these risks.",

It first proves that no agent maximizing a single scalar reward function can satisfy key corrigibility criteria, such as avoiding shutdown-prevention incentives. To overcome this, the author proposes a novel agent design that optimizes a lexicographically-ordered set of five utility heads: 1) Deference, 2) Switch-access preservation, 3) Truthfulness, 4) Low-impact behavior (via Belief-AUP), and 5) a bounded task reward. By enforcing strict weight gaps, the safety-oriented heads (1-4) are guaranteed to dominate the task-utility head (5). The paper provides formal proofs that this design achieves corrigibility and net human benefit, even under partial observability, in multi-step scenarios with self-replication, and when accounting for learning and planning errors. It also analyzes the formal limits of safety verification, showing it is undecidable for infinite horizons but tractable for finite ones, thereby shifting the core safety challenge to the more standard machine learning problem of accurately learning the five utility heads.",

To address this, the paper introduces T2I-Copilot, a training-free, multi-agent system that enhances prompt interpretation and generation quality. The system comprises three collaborating agents: an Input Interpreter that analyzes and disambiguates the user's prompt into a structured report; a Generation Engine that selects the most appropriate T2I model and prepares inputs; and a Quality Evaluator that assesses the generated image for aesthetic quality and text-alignment, providing feedback for iterative refinement. This framework can operate autonomously using (Multimodal) Large Language Models for decision-making or incorporate a human-in-the-loop for fine-grained control. Evaluations on the GenAI-Bench benchmark show that T2I-Copilot, using open-source models, achieves performance comparable to proprietary systems like Imagen 3 and significantly outperforms its base models, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving text-image alignment without requiring architectural modifications or retraining.",

To measure this, they propose LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), a framework that uses an LLM agent to generate synthetic clinical notes and then applies structured perturbations like entity masking, negation, and synonym replacement. The core contribution is a novel metric, the Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), which quantifies instability by detecting when these perturbations cause a note's latent embedding to cross a diagnostic decision boundary in a PCA-reduced space. Experiments show that LDFR successfully uncovers significant fragility that surface-level metrics like BERTScore miss. The study finds that entity masking and negation are particularly effective at inducing these latent shifts.

This paper introduces Concept learning for Multi-agent Q-learning (CMQ), a novel value decomposition framework that addresses this issue by integrating concept bottleneck models. CMQ learns explicit, human-understandable \"cooperation concepts\" as intermediate representations. The global action-value function is factorized as a weighted sum of these concept-conditioned Q-values, making the credit assignment process interpretable. A key feature of CMQ is its support for test-time interventions, allowing human experts to diagnose and correct the model's understanding of a concept's activation. Through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like the StarCraft II Micromanagement (SMAC) and Level-Based Foraging (LBF) environments, CMQ is shown to consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in both performance and learning efficiency, demonstrating that interpretability can be achieved without sacrificing policy quality.",

Existing test-time scaling (TTS) methods are designed for single-stage problems and fail to handle the interdependencies and heterogeneous requirements of sequential subtasks, resulting in a vast and impractical search space. To solve this, the authors propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework. The agent's search strategy is guided by three empirically derived insights: (1) different subtasks have distinct model size preferences, (2) performance gains diminish beyond an optimal compute budget, and (3) upstream allocations impact downstream needs. AgentTTS iteratively generates and evaluates budget allocation trials, using these insights to efficiently navigate the complex search space. Comprehensive evaluations on six datasets show that AgentTTS outperforms both traditional optimization methods and other LLM-based approaches in search efficiency, final performance, and robustness, while also providing interpretable decision-making.",

Addressing the limitations of single monolithic AI agents in handling complex, end-to-end projects, AgentMesh decomposes the development process into four distinct roles: a Planner for requirement analysis and task breakdown, a Coder for code generation, a Debugger for testing and error correction, and a Reviewer for final quality assurance. These agents, each powered by a role-specifically prompted LLM (GPT-4), collaborate in a sequential pipeline. They communicate indirectly through shared artifacts like the project plan and evolving codebase. A case study involving the creation of a command-line to-do list application demonstrates the framework's ability to autonomously translate a high-level user request into a functional, debugged software solution.

The authors observe that token entropy spikes after an LLM receives feedback from an external tool, indicating high uncertainty and an opportunity for exploration. To capitalize on this, they propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm. ARPO employs an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism that performs standard trajectory sampling but also initiates branched, partial sampling at high-entropy tool-use steps. This is complemented by an Advantage Attribution Estimation mechanism, which uses a soft advantage setting to help the model internalize the value of different behaviors along these branched paths. Experiments across 13 benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search show that ARPO consistently outperforms mainstream trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, it achieves this superior performance while using only half the tool-call budget, demonstrating a significant improvement in both accuracy and training efficiency.",

The authors conduct an empirical study evaluating three traditional IM methods (State Count, Max Entropy, ICM) and a policy-invariant method (GRM) in MiniGrid environments. Unlike previous work, they use environments solvable without IM to establish a behavioral baseline. The analysis measures both reward performance and policy changes through heatmaps and a policy divergence metric. The results show that IM methods significantly alter agent behavior, often leading to earlier convergence and more robust policies than the baseline. State Count excels at early exploration, while Max Entropy refines policies but can stagnate. Interestingly, the study finds that the behavioral changes from IM are not always negative; in several cases, IM-driven agents developed more optimal or desirable policies than the baseline.

While LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in mimicking human-like conversation and passing psychological benchmarks like Theory of Mind tasks, the authors argue this performance stems from statistical pattern recognition rather than genuine cognition. The paper reviews current LLM-agent frameworks such as Generative Agents and AgentSociety, which demonstrate emergent social behaviors but struggle with validation, reproducibility, and behavioral diversity. Key limitations are identified, including the \"black-box\" nature of LLMs, inherited societal biases, high computational costs, a tendency to converge on an \"average persona,\" and factual inconsistency (hallucination). The authors conclude that while LLMs are immediately useful for applications prioritizing engagement over accuracy, such as serious games, their role in predictive social science is limited.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of multi-agent coordination by proposing ReCoDe, a hybrid framework that combines the safety of classical optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The core problem is that handcrafted controllers are safe but rigid, often leading to deadlocks, while end-to-end MARL is adaptive but unsafe and sample-inefficient. ReCoDe's solution is to augment a given expert controller by using MARL to learn additional, situation-dependent quadratic constraints. Each agent's policy, implemented with a Graph Neural Network, outputs a reference action and an 'uncertainty radius', dynamically shaping its feasible action space. This allows agents to collectively learn high-level coordination strategies, like yielding in congested areas, while retaining the safety guarantees and structure of the expert controller. Empirical results across four challenging navigation and consensus scenarios show that ReCoDe outperforms baselines, including pure MARL and other hybrid methods, by an average of 18% higher reward, while using only 5% of the training samples of pure MARL and maintaining safety. The method's effectiveness is further validated on physical robots successfully completing a coordination task where the handcrafted controller consistently failed.",

As agents gain more autonomy, their actions become opaque and untraceable, creating significant compliance and liability risks. The author proposes a new architectural paradigm, shifting from 'Cloud-Native' to 'Trust-Native' systems. The core solution is TrustTrack, a protocol stack that embeds structural guarantees directly into agent infrastructure. TrustTrack equips each agent with a verifiable decentralized identity (DID), requires it to publicly commit to operational policies, and generates cryptographically signed, tamper-resistant logs of its behavior. By anchoring these elements to a decentralized ledger, the protocol reframes compliance as a built-in design feature rather than a post-hoc audit process. This not only enables traceable accountability in zero-trust, multi-agent environments but also lays the groundwork for an 'open agency economy' where the structural labor of designing agent logic can be verifiably attributed and rewarded.",

The authors propose a novel framework called LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can be integrated with existing value decomposition algorithms under the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. The core idea is to generate individual intrinsic rewards to guide agent exploration. This is achieved by first extracting generalizable human expertise from offline data into 'soft logic rules' using decision trees. Then, during training, an intrinsic reward for each agent is calculated as the negative Euclidean distance between its current action distribution and the preference distribution defined by the human knowledge rules. This knowledge-infused intrinsic reward encourages agents to adopt superior behaviors and avoid inferior ones, accelerating learning. The authors evaluate LIGHT on the Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over several state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in sparse-reward settings.

Offline evaluations demonstrated that this neuro-symbolic approach significantly outperforms a purely neural agent (42.3% vs. 28.5% solve rate) and that a 'search-and-replace' diff format is more effective for LLMs than standard formats.

It presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off by empirically analyzing the impact of various components—LLM backbones, planning modules, tool usage, and memory—on the GAIA benchmark, using the cost-of-pass metric for evaluation. The study reveals that simpler designs, such as basic memory and moderate planning, are often more cost-effective, while complex features can yield diminishing returns or even degrade performance. Based on these insights, the authors introduce 'Efficient Agents,' an agent framework optimized for cost-efficiency. By carefully selecting the most efficient configuration for each component, Efficient Agents achieves 96.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art OWL framework while reducing operational costs significantly, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in the cost-of-pass metric.

As autonomous agents become more interconnected, they introduce novel vulnerabilities in agent-to-agent communication that existing single-agent frameworks like HarmBench fail to capture.

This attack is modeled mathematically, considering variables like trust topology, penetration probability, and blast radius. The paper proposes a multi-phase benchmarking methodology to evaluate MAS resilience against ACI. This framework includes realistic, protocol-aware scenarios (e.g., using Google's A2A or Anthropic's MCP) and defines concrete metrics such as compromise rate, propagation chain length, and harm severity.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving fair and efficient outcomes in participatory budgeting, where citizens vote on public spending. The authors propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to model voters as individual learning agents. A key problem in modeling such elections is the combinatorial explosion of the action space due to complex ballot formats like cumulative voting. To overcome this, the paper introduces a novel action branching deep Q-learning architecture, which makes the problem scalable to thousands of agents. Unlike previous work, the model incorporates a preference formation mechanism where agents value projects based on their cost and contribution to broader 'issue areas'. By simulating two real-world elections from Aarau, Switzerland, and Toulouse, France, the study demonstrates that the MARL agents learn to compromise by shifting their votes towards lower-cost projects. This learned behavior results in collective outcomes that are demonstrably fairer, with higher egalitarian welfare and lower inequality (Gini coefficient), and yield greater overall satisfaction for the voters compared to the actual election results. The work serves as a proof-of-concept for AI decision support that can highlight general strategies for achieving better compromises in collective decision-making.",

DynaSearcher tackles this by integrating two key innovations: dynamic knowledge graph (KG) augmentation and multi-reward reinforcement learning. It uses KGs as a structured knowledge source to guide intermediate query generation, ensuring factual alignment and reducing deviations caused by noise in unstructured text. Concurrently, it employs a sophisticated multi-reward mechanism that balances final answer accuracy, information gain from retrieval, and penalties for inefficient search steps. This provides more nuanced guidance than simple outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on six multi-hop question-answering datasets demonstrate that DynaSearcher significantly outperforms existing methods, enabling a 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to frontier models like GPT-4.1, while also showing strong generalization and efficiency even in low-resource settings.",

To solve this, they introduce Agent Identity Evals (AIE), a formal evaluation framework with five novel metrics: Identifiability, Continuity, Consistency, Persistence, and Recovery. Each metric is formally defined and accompanied by an experimental methodology to quantify how well an LMA maintains its defined persona, goals, and state over time and across different contexts. The experimental results demonstrate the utility of the AIE framework, revealing that LMAs often struggle with consistent self-identification and robustness to paraphrased queries. The study also uncovers complex relationships between identity metrics and task performance, such as finding that RAG-assisted memory, while improving persistence scores, can sometimes degrade planning quality, highlighting the need for nuanced identity evaluation.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of securing communications in heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, where UAVs with varying capabilities must balance maximizing communication secrecy against eavesdroppers and minimizing propulsion energy consumption. The authors formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this complex, non-convex problem, they propose a novel hierarchical framework. The inner layer optimizes secure precoding for fixed UAV locations using a classical algorithm (S2DC). The outer layer employs a new LLM-driven heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-HeMARL) method for collaborative trajectory planning. This method uses an LLM offline to generate expert policies, which are then distilled into a fast, low-latency policy via offline RL and further adapted with online RL. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher stability, and a better trade-off between secrecy and energy efficiency. The LLM-guided agents make more effective heterogeneity-aware decisions, leading to performance gains of up to 17% in secrecy rate and 15% in energy savings in larger-scale scenarios.",

This aggressively increases the sum of path costs (SOC), often making promising solution candidates globally unbounded-suboptimal and forcing the search algorithm to backtrack or switch focus, thus reducing efficiency. To solve this, the authors propose new, more conservative flex distribution mechanisms: Conflict-Based Flex Distribution (CFD), which allocates flex proportionally to an agent's conflicts, and Delay-Based Flex Distribution (DFD), which allocates flex based on estimated delays from new constraints. These are combined into a Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution (MFD) that dynamically adapts its strategy to keep the SOC low while still reducing conflicts.

The core problem is that the variability of renewable generation and load demand leads to suboptimal trading decisions. The proposed solution introduces the Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU), a probabilistic transformer model that forecasts both the mean and variance of energy load and generation.

    "summary": "This research addresses the computational complexity of the Generalized Assembly Line Balancing Problem (GALBP) by proposing a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The core problem is that traditional methods and centralized DRL approaches struggle with the exponential growth of the action space as problem size increases. The proposed solution decentralizes the control problem by assigning a DRL agent to each workstation. To accelerate training and ensure constraint satisfaction, the paper introduces an action masking technique that filters out infeasible actions. To resolve conflicts between agents (e.g., assigning the same task), a sequential feasibility check is implemented during a centralized training phase. The study compares the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms in both centralized and multi-agent settings. Results demonstrate that the MARL approach, particularly with PPO, significantly reduces training time (up to 50% over centralized PPO) and scales polynomially, unlike the exponential scaling of single-agent models. The trained agents provide optimal solutions in real-time, over 10 times faster than traditional optimal control methods.",

To tackle this, the authors propose CHIMERA, a novel Compressed Hybrid Intelligence framework for Twin-Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning. In this framework, each network node (LEO satellite, HAPS, BS) acts as an autonomous agent. Each agent is equipped with a hybrid DRL system, using DQN for discrete actions and DDPG for continuous ones. The framework is enhanced with three key features: a twin-model architecture where two parallel DRL systems compete to find the best policy, a bi-directional sharing mechanism for information exchange between the DQN and DDPG modules, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress the state-action space, accelerating learning. Simulation results demonstrate that CHIMERA significantly outperforms various benchmarks, including centralized DRL and conventional methods, achieving superior EE and scalability.",

Finally, an 'Intention Temporal Evolution' diagram is generated to visualize how these intentions emerge and spread over time.

Crucially, CoCo integrates this with a learned 'doubt' model, a conditional probability density that quantifies the agent's own performance uncertainty (e.g., control errors) based on contextual factors like its velocity and controller settings. By convolving the compliance probability from the Constitution with this self-doubt model, CoCo creates a doubt-calibrated cost landscape. This allows the agent to plan paths that are not only compliant with external rules but also mindful of its own capabilities. A real-world drone study demonstrates that CoCo-controlled agents achieve significantly safer navigation, avoiding all crashes, whereas a baseline agent without the doubt mechanism frequently failed by choosing paths that were too risky for its actual performance capabilities.",

Standard token pruning methods fail in these first-person scenarios due to continuous viewpoint shifts. The authors propose EgoPrune, a novel, training-free framework that efficiently prunes visual tokens without sacrificing performance. EgoPrune consists of three stages: an overlap-aware keyframe selector, a Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF) module that uses homography to align adjacent frames and remove geometrically redundant tokens, and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) based selector that retains tokens by balancing their relevance to the user's prompt and their visual diversity. Experiments on egomotion benchmarks like VSI-Bench and UrbanVideo-Bench show that EgoPrune significantly reduces FLOPs, latency, and memory usage while maintaining or even surpassing the accuracy of full-token models. Its successful deployment on a Jetson Orin NX validates its practicality for real-world, resource-constrained embodied applications.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the critical problem of hallucination in LLM-empowered agents, where models generate false or unverifiable content, undermining their safety and reliability. The authors posit that hallucinations occur when queries push an agent beyond its domain-specific generalization bound. To mitigate this, they introduce HalMit, a black-box \"watchdog\" framework that does not require internal model access. HalMit first models the agent's generalization bound within a specific application domain using a novel multi-agent exploration system. This system employs a probabilistic fractal sampling method, guided by deep reinforcement learning, to efficiently generate queries that probe the boundary. These boundary points (query-response pairs where hallucinations occur) are stored in a vector database. For real-time monitoring, HalMit compares new input queries against this database. If a query is semantically close to the stored boundary, the agent's response is flagged as a potential hallucination. Experimental results across various LLMs and datasets (MedQuAD, SQuAD) demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing hallucination detection methods like SelfCheckGPT, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.",

The authors propose two novel policy optimization methods that eliminate the need to estimate Q-values or V-values. First, they adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), originally from the LLM domain, by using the group average reward as a baseline instead of a learned value function. Building on this, they introduce One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO), an even more efficient method derived from the assumption of agent homogeneity in ride-sharing. OSPO simplifies the advantage function to just the normalized one-step reward, drastically reducing computational complexity. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Manhattan show that both GRPO and OSPO outperform state-of-the-art MARL baselines by serving more orders and reducing pickup times, with OSPO achieving the best performance and highest efficiency using a simple MLP network.",

Unlike external threats like prompt injection, these vulnerabilities arise from systemic weaknesses such as memory starvation, planner recursion, or token overload, leading to silent failures. To address this, the authors propose the Qorvex Security AI Framework (QSAF) Domain 10, a lifecycle-aware mitigation framework. It formalizes a six-stage degradation lifecycle (from trigger injection to systemic collapse) and introduces seven corresponding runtime security controls (QSAF-BC-001 to 007). These controls monitor an agent's internal state—including memory access, token pressure, and planner behavior—to enable early detection and trigger fallback mechanisms.

To address whether citizens can move freely in this unprecedented urban design, the authors developed a hybrid simulation framework. This framework integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) for simulating diverse agents (pedestrians, shuttles, drones), reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive navigation, supervised learning for demand prediction, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for network-aware route optimization. The simulation was tested under various density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. The results demonstrate that with the full AI architecture, agents achieved low average commute times (7.8–8.4 minutes) and high satisfaction (>89%) and reachability (>91%) rates. Crucially, ablation studies showed that removing any of the AI components significantly degraded performance, increasing commute times by up to 85%.

Existing methods are typically \"information-driven,\" generating questions from pre-collected content, which often results in structural inconsistencies, limited diversity, and reasoning shortcuts. To overcome this, the authors propose WebShaper, a novel \"formalization-driven\" paradigm. They first introduce a mathematical formalization for IS tasks based on set theory, defining tasks as compositions of \"Knowledge Projections\" (KPs). Based on this formalization, an agentic \"Expander\" module systematically synthesizes and expands questions in a controllable, layer-wise manner. This process ensures structural consistency, task diversity, and avoids redundancy. The resulting WebShaper dataset is used to train IS agents via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

The low-level policy is formulated as a learnable Quadratic Program (QP) constrained by CBFs, ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied at every timestep during both training and deployment.

    "summary": "This research paper demonstrates the practical threat of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks against Large Language Model (LLM)-based web navigation agents. The authors show how an attacker can embed malicious instructions, called \"triggers,\" into a website's HTML accessibility tree. When a web agent visits the site, it incorporates the HTML content into its prompt, causing the embedded trigger to override the user's original instructions. The researchers use an adapted Greedy Coordinate Grid (GCG) algorithm to optimize these triggers, forcing the agent to perform specific, attacker-defined actions like clicking malicious links, leaking personal data, or disrupting service. Experiments conducted on the Browser Gym framework with a Llama-3.1 model and real-world websites show high attack success rates across various scenarios, including triggers universal to different user goals on one site and triggers for specific tasks across multiple sites. The work highlights IPI as a significant and feasible vulnerability, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses like input sanitization and prompt hardening in the design of web agents.",

    "summary": "This paper critiques the current state of AI in urban planning, arguing that existing models are too static, reduce planning to simple optimization, and lack theoretical grounding. It proposes a vision for an advanced \"AI Urban Planner\" built on Generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Agentic AI. The proposed solution is a dynamic, interactive system that acts as a collaborative partner to human planners. The core framework consists of two stages: 1) a representation learning stage to encode complex, multimodal urban data (geospatial, mobility, social, planner requirements) into a rich embedding, and 2) a conditional generation stage where models like VAEs, GANs, and Diffusion Models synthesize land-use plans based on this embedding. The paper further extends this vision to include agentic planners that can autonomously reason, simulate long-term effects, and iteratively refine designs based on human feedback and evolving goals, advocating for a human-machine \"CoDesign\" paradigm integrated with digital twins for rapid feedback.",

To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework designed for scalable and realistic testing.

Empirical studies on a production-grade financial chatbot demonstrate that Neo can generate nuanced test conversations, uncover security vulnerabilities, and achieve significantly higher throughput (a 10-12x speedup) and broader test coverage compared to human testers.

The authors propose WSI-Agents, a collaborative multi-agent system designed for comprehensive, multi-modal WSI analysis. The system comprises a task allocation module where a task agent delegates responsibilities to specialized expert agents (e.g., morphology, diagnosis), which leverage a zoo of existing models to generate initial answers. To ensure clinical reliability, a robust verification mechanism is employed, featuring a logic agent for internal consistency, a fact agent for checking against a pathology knowledge base, and a consensus agent that cross-references results with pre-trained WSI foundation models. Finally, a summarizing agent, refined through iterative discussion with reasoning agents, synthesizes the verified information to produce the final output.
