This paper introduces Foam-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate intelligent CFD simulations. Foam-Agent employs an Architect, Input Writer, Runner, and Reviewer Agent, supported by three key innovations: a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system for context-specific knowledge, a dependency-aware file generation process ensuring consistency across configuration files, and an iterative error correction mechanism for autonomous diagnosis and resolution of simulation failures. Evaluated on 110 diverse OpenFOAM cases, Foam-Agent achieved an 83.6% executable success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, substantially outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (55.5%) and OpenFOAMGPT-Alt (37.3%).

To address this, the authors conduct the first systematic evaluation of MAS execution traces using Grounded Theory, analyzing over 200 conversation traces from 7 diverse open-source MAS frameworks. This rigorous analysis, involving six expert human annotators, led to the identification of 14 distinct failure modes, clustered into three categories (Specification Issues, Inter-Agent Misalignment, Task Verification), forming the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST).

Case studies demonstrate that interventions guided by MAST, such as improved role specifications and architectural changes, can yield significant performance improvements (e.g., +15.6% for ChatDev).

The primary objective is to guide a group of agents to a specific target formation, which is a linear transformation of a pre-defined nominal configuration, even allowing dimensions higher than the agents' coordinates. The proposed LFC architecture allows formations to dynamically adjust through arbitrary linear transformations, enhancing adaptability to various environments. Key contributions include the concept of \"linear localizability\" to ensure leaders uniquely determine the target formation, and a linear formation control method utilizing a pre-defined stress matrix. Furthermore, for scenarios where the stress matrix is unavailable, the paper designs distributed estimators and proposes an estimation-driven LFC method based on the graph Laplacian matrix.

This paper introduces MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to address this gap by evaluating LLM-based multi-agent systems across six diverse interactive scenarios, including collaborative coding, research tasks, Minecraft building, database error analysis, and competitive games like Werewolf and Bargaining. Alongside the benchmark, the paper proposes MARBLE (Multi-agent cooRdination Backbone with LLM Engine), a flexible framework supporting various communication topologies (star, tree, graph, chain) and reasoning strategies (e.g., cognitive self-evolving planning). Novel evaluation metrics are introduced, encompassing milestone-based Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), structured planning and communication scores, and a dedicated competition score, validated by human evaluation. Experimental results reveal that while intrinsic model capabilities are crucial, coordination plays a complex role, sometimes failing to compensate for execution deficiencies. Graph-based coordination and cognitive self-evolving planning demonstrate superior performance. The study also highlights emergent social behaviors, such as strategic information disclosure and role-driven collaboration, providing insights towards AGI-level collaboration.

    "summary": "The paper investigates a debate-based framework as a scalable oversight mechanism for aligning advanced LLMs, particularly when models surpass human expertise and ground-truth labels become scarce. Inspired by Irving et al. (2018), the approach involves \"weaker\" non-expert judges evaluating arguments from \"stronger\" expert debaters in an information-asymmetric reading comprehension task, augmented with a quote verification tool. Comparing debate to a consultancy baseline using both human and LLM judges, the study demonstrates that debate significantly improves judge accuracy (88% for human, 76% for LLM judges) over naive baselines and consultancy. A key finding is that optimizing debaters for persuasiveness—an unsupervised metric based on judge approval—enhances their ability to argue for the correct answer, thereby increasing judge accuracy. Human judges also exhibit better calibration and lower error rates with debate. Conversely, increased persuasiveness in the consultancy protocol leads to a degradation of judge accuracy, as consultants can become more adept at advocating incorrect answers. The work highlights debate's robustness and promise for eliciting truthful answers in settings where judges lack privileged information.",

This paper introduces meta-prompting, a novel task-agnostic scaffolding technique designed to enhance LM performance and robustness.

    "summary": "This paper introduces AgentCoord, a visual exploration framework designed to simplify the creation of coordination strategies for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, addressing challenges like natural language ambiguity and cognitive overload from text-heavy interfaces. AgentCoord proposes a structured representation for coordination strategies—comprising Plan Outline, Agent Assignment, and Task Process—which serves as a foundational scaffolding. Leveraging LLMs' capabilities, it generates an initial strategy from a user's general goal through a three-stage process. The framework visually organizes this strategy using elements like bipartite graphs for task dependencies and agent cards, significantly enhancing comprehension. It also supports interactive, multi-thread exploration of alternative strategies for each stage with LLM assistance, for example, using heatmaps to visualize LLM's prior knowledge for agent assignments. Finally, AgentCoord provides visually enhanced execution results with explicit linkages to the strategy design, aiding efficient analysis and debugging. A formal user study with 12 participants demonstrated AgentCoord's effectiveness, showing improved comprehension, facilitated design, and better result analysis compared to baseline text-based systems, thus enabling broader general users to design complex agent coordination strategies.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently suffer from factual hallucinations and reasoning errors due to the uncurated nature of their training data. Existing methods to improve accuracy typically focus on single model instances. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent debate approach where multiple LLM instances (agents) collaboratively refine answers. Given a query, agents first generate individual candidate responses. Then, over several rounds, each agent reads and critiques the responses of all others, using this feedback to update its own answer. This iterative process encourages the models to construct answers consistent with internal and external critiques, often converging on a single, more accurate consensus. The debate method significantly outperforms single-model baselines, such as zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and reflection, across six diverse reasoning and factuality tasks, including arithmetic, grade school math, chess, and a new benchmark for computer scientist biographies. Key findings show that both the number of agents and debate rounds are crucial for optimal performance, and surprisingly, debate can lead to correct answers even when all agents initially provide incorrect predictions. While computationally more expensive, the approach offers substantial improvements in LLM reliability and is compatible with black-box models, suggesting potential for self-improvement loops or enhanced data generation.",

Building upon Bayesian Theory-of-Mind and Rational Speech Act theory, the authors propose a novel Bayesian model that treats a human-robot team as a single group agent, thereby simplifying complex recursive mental reasoning. The model, implemented as a probabilistic program, includes a goal prior, a joint planner utilizing real-time A* search, and an utterance model that leverages a pre-trained neural language model (GPT-3 Curie) to interpret instructions based on salient actions. Through computational and human experiments in a multi-agent gridworld, the model's goal inferences were found to be highly correlated with human judgments. A key finding is that language instructions significantly accelerate goal inference, improve accuracy, and reduce observer uncertainty compared to relying solely on actions, though actions remain vital for disambiguating remaining ambiguities. These results validate the model as a plausible explanation for human goal inference and suggest a promising path for designing more communicative and cooperatively intelligent AI systems.",

It addresses the need for a systematic understanding of these agents, which overcome the limitations of traditional models by leveraging LLMs' human-like intelligence for self-directed planning and action in open-domain settings. The paper offers a structured analysis by focusing on three core aspects: construction, application, and evaluation. For construction, it proposes a unified agent architecture comprising profiling, memory, planning, and action modules, alongside categorizing capability acquisition strategies into fine-tuning and non-fine-tuning methods like prompt and mechanism engineering. It then extensively reviews the diverse applications of these agents across social science (psychology, social simulation, jurisprudence), natural science (experiment assistance, data management), and engineering (software development, robotics). Finally, the survey details evaluation methodologies, distinguishing between subjective (human annotation, Turing test) and objective (metrics, protocols, benchmarks) approaches. The findings consolidate existing research into comprehensive taxonomies, highlighting significant challenges such as role-playing accuracy, nuanced human alignment, prompt robustness, hallucination, controlling LLM knowledge in simulations, and inference speed, thereby guiding future research in this burgeoning domain.",

    "summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of creating interactive recommender systems that leverage the conversational power of Large Language Models (LLMs) while overcoming their limitations in handling domain-specific, private, or new item data. Traditional recommender systems lack conversational interfaces, and general LLMs often struggle with fine-grained recommendations, leading to issues like hallucination. To solve this, the authors propose InteRecAgent, a compact LLM-based agent framework that integrates LLMs with three distinct sets of traditional recommendation tools: querying, retrieval, and ranking. The framework introduces advanced modules including a \"shared candidate bus\" for efficient inter-tool communication of item candidates, \"long-term and short-term user profiles\" for enhanced personalization across dialogues, a \"dynamic demonstration-augmented plan-first strategy\" for robust and cost-effective task planning, and an \"actor-critic reflection strategy\" for error detection and correction. Furthermore, to democratize the framework, they developed RecLlama, a 7-billion-parameter LlaMA 2 model fine-tuned on a GPT-4 generated dataset of tool execution plans. Experiments on Steam, MovieLens, and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate InteRecAgent's superior performance in terms of hit rate and average turns in interactive recommendations, significantly outperforming general LLMs, particularly in less-covered, private domains like Amazon Beauty where LLMs often hallucinate. RecLlama also shows impressive capabilities, surpassing larger models and demonstrating strong generalization, making the framework more accessible. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each proposed mechanism to the overall effectiveness.",

This paper proposes ReConcile, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages a \"round-table conference\" among diverse LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude2) to improve reasoning via consensus. ReConcile involves agents initially generating answers, explanations, and confidence scores, followed by multi-round discussions. In each round, agents revise their responses by considering grouped answers, explanations, confidence from others, and \"convincing samples\" (human explanations that rectify incorrect answers). A weighted voting scheme, based on recalibrated confidence, determines the final team answer once consensus is reached. Experiments across seven benchmarks, including commonsense, mathematical, logical, and NLI tasks, demonstrate that ReConcile consistently outperforms strong single-agent (Self-Refine, Self-Consistency) and same-model multi-agent (Debate, Judge) baselines. Notably, ReConcile even surpasses GPT-4 on some benchmarks (e.g., StrategyQA, and MATH when incorporating DeepSeekMath).

Traditional LLM agent planning struggles with fine-grained, multi-constraint tasks requiring heterogeneous action sequences, often leading to suboptimal results. PMC tackles this by hierarchically decomposing a main task into subordinate sub-tasks via a manager agent, which also categorizes constraints as 'local' or 'global'. Executor agents then perform step-level planning and execution for each sub-task, adhering to local constraints, while a supervisor agent refines sub-tasks based on previous outcomes. Finally, a deliverer agent synthesizes all sub-task results to satisfy global constraints and produce the final outcome. Evaluated on two constraint-intensive benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank, PMC achieved a 42.68% success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly outperforming GPT-4 (2.92%), and surpassed GPT-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by 13.64%.

Existing memory-augmented methods often lack context-awareness and struggle with response correctness. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose CAIM, a Cognitive AI Memory Framework. CAIM integrates retrieval-augmented methods with cognitive AI principles, positioning the LLM as a central decision unit. It comprises three modules: a Memory Controller for selective retrieval, a Memory Retrieval module with a novel ontology-based tagging system and contextual/time-based filtering, and a Post-Thinking module for memory extension and review. Evaluated on the public Generated Virtual Dataset, CAIM significantly outperforms existing frameworks like MemoryBank and Think-in-Memory across metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and contextual coherence, particularly with GPT-4o. Ablation studies confirm the crucial roles of the Memory Controller and filtering mechanism. While CAIM enhances long-term interactions and personalization by effectively managing memory, it exhibits limitations in handling highly detailed queries and understanding relative time-based units due to its design prioritizing concise inductive thoughts over granular information.",

    "summary": "The paper introduces Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel framework addressing the challenge of dynamically configuring optimal communication topologies for multi-agent LLM systems. Current methods often rely on static, human-designed graphs or only prune communication links, overlooking the critical need to select the most relevant agents. AGP proposes a two-stage approach: first, it collects a diverse dataset of task-optimized subgraphs from a fixed agent pool, serving as ground-truth supervision for node masks and edge weights. Second, it trains a dual-pruning Graph Neural Network (GNN) that jointly performs hard pruning (selecting agent subsets) and soft pruning (optimizing communication strengths between agents) based on task semantics. Evaluated across six benchmarks spanning general, mathematical, and code reasoning, AGP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with an average improvement of 2.58% to 9.84% over existing baselines. Crucially, it drastically reduces inference token consumption by up to 90% and demonstrates superior training efficiency, converging faster than competitors. AGP's ability to adapt communication structures and agent teams dynamically, even discovering counter-intuitive yet effective agent combinations, makes it a highly efficient and adaptable solution for complex multi-agent LLM ecosystems.",

This paper introduces a novel framework for self-evolving LLM agents designed to autonomously improve their long-horizon strategic planning. The researchers developed four agent architectures, ranging from a basic LLM agent to sophisticated multi-agent systems (PromptEvolver and AgentEvolver) that iteratively refine prompts or rewrite their own game-playing code. These systems draw inspiration from multi-role AI frameworks and self-reflection techniques. Evaluating these agents against a strong heuristic-based bot (AlphaBeta) in Catanatron, the study demonstrates that agents with iterative self-improvement capabilities achieve consistently higher performance, exhibiting more coherent strategies and higher average victory points than static baselines. Notably, the PromptEvolver, especially when powered by stronger models like Claude 3.7, showed up to a 95% improvement.

    "summary": "Existing medical AI, primarily large language models (LLMs), excels at acquiring medical knowledge from text but struggles with practical expertise gained through hospital experience, a critical phase for human doctors. Current LLM-powered agents also lack the ability to continuously learn and evolve from interactions. This paper introduces \"Agent Hospital,\" a novel simulacrum where LLM-powered autonomous agents (patients, nurses, and doctors) interact in a virtual hospital environment. The proposed \"Simulacrum-based Evolutionary Agent Learning (SEAL)\" paradigm, featuring the MedAgent-Zero method, enables doctor agents to acquire and refine medical expertise. SEAL constructs the virtual hospital by coupling LLMs with medical knowledge bases to automatically generate diverse patient data, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Doctor agents then evolve by treating these patient agents, storing successful cases in a medical case base, and deriving rules from failures for an experience base. Evaluation in the virtual world shows significant improvements in medical examination selection, diagnosis, and treatment plan recommendation, with diagnostic accuracy consistently increasing as doctor agents treat more patients. Importantly, the expertise gained in Agent Hospital is transferable to real-world scenarios, as evolved doctor agents outperform state-of-the-art methods on the MedQA dataset without using any labeled training data from the benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of this self-evolutionary approach.",

The proposed solution is a novel agentic workflow named PReP (Perceive, Reflect, and Plan). PReP utilizes a fine-tuned LLaVA model for accurate visual perception of landmarks and inference of goal direction/distance. A memory module, encompassing episodic and semantic memory, enables the agent to reflect on past experiences, form a cognitive map, and make robust inferences even when landmarks are invisible. A planning module then generates long-term navigation plans, breaking down paths into sub-goals. Evaluated on datasets from four major cities, PReP significantly outperforms existing language-based and reinforcement learning baselines, achieving an average success rate of 54%.

The authors propose a two-pronged approach: first, fundamentally improving LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using a novel agent-specific dataset. This dataset is meticulously constructed by leveraging GPT-4 to simulate multi-turn dialogues between an agent, a user, and an environment, capturing interactive behaviors, internal thought processes, and decision-making. This agent data is then mixed with general instruction tuning data to preserve generalizability. Second, the approach integrates advanced reasoning strategies including task decomposition, which breaks complex tasks into simpler subtasks, and multi-path reasoning with backtracking, allowing the agent to explore alternative solutions and avoid suboptimal paths. Evaluated on AgentBench, the SFT with constructed agent data significantly boosts performance across tasks like Operating System and WebShop, outperforming other instruction tuning methods. The multi-branch reasoning further improves results, especially on planning-intensive (ALFWorld) and API invocation tasks, demonstrating a promising pathway to making smaller LLMs more effective and robust AI agents.",

    "summary": "Non-expert human planners face challenges in complex, dynamic environments, often struggling with symbolic planning tools due to their strict formats. While LLMs can translate natural language to symbolic specifications, they frequently introduce errors or miss user intent, and lack robust plan space exploration. This paper introduces PlanCritic, a neurosymbolic framework designed for collaborative human-AI planning. PlanCritic uses GPT-4 to convert user preferences into mid-level goals and initial PDDL constraints. It then employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize these constraints, leveraging an LSTM-based reward model trained with human feedback to evaluate plan adherence to natural language preferences, and an external symbolic planner (Optic) for plan generation. This approach allows PlanCritic to efficiently search the plan space beyond initial LLM outputs. Experimental results in a waterway restoration domain demonstrate that PlanCritic, with its GA-based optimization, achieves a 75% success rate in adapting plans to changing user preferences, significantly outperforming LLM-only approaches (53% success). PlanCritic is particularly effective at correcting initial LLM mistakes, succeeding 88% of the time when the LLM's initial guess is wrong, though it occasionally introduces errors in initially correct LLM plans due to reward model limitations with \"near miss\" scenarios.",

It proposes AgentCoder, a novel multi-agent framework featuring three specialized agents: a programmer agent for code generation and iterative refinement, a test designer agent for independently generating accurate, diverse, and comprehensive test cases (basic, edge, large-scale), and a test executor agent for dynamic code validation in a local environment. AgentCoder significantly outperforms 14 LLMs and 16 state-of-the-art optimization baselines, achieving an average of 91.5% and 84.1% pass@1 with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respectively, which is a notable improvement over prior SOTA (e.g., 8.8% higher than CodeCoT). Furthermore, AgentCoder drastically reduces token overhead (e.g., 56.9K for HumanEval compared to MetaGPT's 138.2K) and achieves superior test generation accuracy and code coverage, validating the effectiveness of its streamlined multi-agent design and objective test generation strategy.",

Addressing the limitations of static historical analysis and simplistic traditional simulations, WarAgent models countries as agents with detailed profiles (leadership, military, resources, history, policy, public morale) and a comprehensive action space (e.g., declare war, form alliances, send messages). The architecture includes secretary agents for action validation, a \"Board\" for public relations, and a \"Stick\" for internal states, efficiently managing context by consolidating historical data. To prevent LLMs from simply recalling historical facts, country names and minor historical details are anonymized. Experiments demonstrate WarAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4 achieving high accuracy in replicating historical alliance formations and military mobilizations. Counterfactual analyses reveal that even minor \"null\" triggers can escalate tensions into cold war scenarios, and that agent aggressiveness, historical background, key policies, and public morale are more influential in conflict initiation than military capacity or resources. The research positions LLM-based MAS as a powerful, ethical tool for computational social science, offering new perspectives for historians, policymakers, and educators by enabling the exploration of \"what-if\" scenarios and enhancing the understanding of complex human behaviors and conflict dynamics.",

The critic, unlike the actor, has access to training-time information (e.g., reference solutions) to improve credit assignment. SWEET-RL directly learns the advantage function, parameterized by the mean log probability of actions, using a trajectory-level Bradley-Terry objective. Experiments on ColBench demonstrate that SWEET-RL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms and even matches or surpasses proprietary models like GPT-4o and O1-Mini, showcasing the effectiveness of its design choices, particularly the use of asymmetric information and appropriate learning objectives for generalization.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a benchmark self-evolving framework designed to dynamically evaluate rapidly advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of static benchmarks, data contamination, and the need for fine-grained assessment. The core of the solution is a multi-agent system comprising an instance pre-filter, creator, verifier, and candidate option formulator, which reframes existing benchmark instances into new variants. It supports scalable evaluation (alternative/complex questions), robust evaluation (context paraphrasing, noising, polarity reversing), and fine-grained evaluation (probing sub-abilities). The framework ensures high data accuracy through a double-verification process and can be iteratively applied. Experimental results across seven diverse datasets and multiple LLMs demonstrate that the evolved benchmarks lead to a general performance decline for most models, revealing their true limitations in generalizability and robustness. The framework also widens performance discrepancies between models and across tasks, aiding in informed model selection, and effectively mitigates data contamination issues.

Unlike traditional LLM agents that require sophisticated manual prompt engineering for specific tasks, Agent-Pro employs a novel policy-level reflection and optimization mechanism. It first generates dynamic self- and world-beliefs to inform decision-making, then iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs to calibrate irrational understandings. These reflections are distilled into refined behavioral guidelines and world modeling, which are then integrated into the agent's prompt to evolve its policy. A Depth-First Search (DFS) based optimization process ensures continuous policy enhancement. Evaluated in Blackjack and Limit Texas Hold’em, Agent-Pro significantly outperforms vanilla LLMs and even specialized reinforcement learning models (DQN, DMC).

This paper introduces CORY (Coevolving with the Other You), a novel sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to address these challenges. CORY duplicates the LLM to be fine-tuned into two autonomous agents: a 'pioneer' and an 'observer'. The pioneer generates an initial response, which the observer then utilizes, alongside the original query, to produce its own response, facilitating knowledge transfer. To prevent prompt bias and foster robust, independent capabilities, the roles of these agents are periodically exchanged during training. Both agents are optimized collaboratively using a collective reward. Experiments conducted on GPT-2 and Llama-2 with subjective (IMDB Review) and objective (GSM8K) reward functions demonstrate that CORY significantly surpasses PPO in terms of policy optimality, resilience to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby offering a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.",

To address this gap, this paper introduces LLM-Evolve, a novel evaluation framework that transforms established benchmarks into sequential problem-solving settings. LLMs are evaluated across multiple rounds, receiving feedback on each round's outcome. This feedback is used to build a demonstration memory of successful input-output pairs, which the model can then query via a dense retriever for few-shot learning on future tasks. Applying LLM-Evolve to MMLU, GSM8K, and AgentBench, the study tested eight state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models. Results show that LLMs can achieve significant performance improvements, ranging from 1% to 17%, by leveraging past interactions. The quality of the retrieval algorithm and feedback signals critically influences this evolving capability, with more challenging benchmarks yielding higher gains.

The research surprisingly finds that simple model averaging, which interpolates between pre- and post-RLHF model weights, achieves the strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front compared to a wide range of other mitigation techniques. Theoretical insights are provided, explaining that model averaging enhances performance by increasing feature diversity in shared feature spaces, particularly within low-level transformer layers.

The method employs an Iterative DPO framework where the model autonomously generates new prompts, creates candidate responses, and then evaluates these responses using its own \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" capability to construct preference pairs.

Experiments with Llama 2 70B demonstrate significant iterative improvements in both instruction following performance (e.g., the Iteration 3 model achieves a 20.44% win rate against GPT-4 Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0) and the model's reward modeling ability (pairwise accuracy with human rankings improves from 78.7% to 81.7% across iterations), establishing a virtuous cycle of self-improvement.",

RLCD addresses the limitations of existing methods like RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback), which often generate noisy preference labels due to similar quality outputs, and context distillation, which lacks pairwise preference signal. RLCD generates preference pairs by employing two contrasting prompts: a positive prompt (p+) encouraging a desired attribute and a negative prompt (p-) encouraging its violation. This contrast leads to more differentiated model outputs (o+ and o-) and cleaner, automatically generated preference labels. These pairs are then used to train a preference model, which subsequently guides the LLM alignment via reinforcement learning (PPO). Empirically, RLCD significantly outperforms RLAIF and context distillation baselines across three diverse alignment tasks—harmlessness, helpfulness, and story outline generation—when simulating preference data with both LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-30B models.

Experimental results demonstrate RLC's effectiveness across various tasks: it significantly boosts answering accuracy on challenging BigBench-hard reasoning tasks (from 31.23% to 37.09%) and improves BERTScore for CNN/Daily Mail text summarization.

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes, the authors introduce a parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM). The WKM is trained to self-synthesize knowledge by comparing expert trajectories with those generated by an experienced agent (rejected trajectories). During inference, the WKM provides prior global task knowledge to guide the agent's overall planning and dynamic local state knowledge, obtained via kNN retrieval from a pre-built knowledge base, to constrain local actions. The next action is determined by a weighted combination of probabilities from the agent model and the WKM's retrieved state knowledge. Evaluated on three complex real-world simulated datasets—ALFWorld, WebShop, and ScienceWorld—with state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, Llama-3-8B), the method consistently achieves superior performance over various strong baselines, often surpassing GPT-4.

Existing solutions often require expensive external knowledge or training from scratch. SE addresses these limitations by operating in two stages: \"self-questioning,\" where the existing PLM identifies informative yet under-explored tokens based on its own prediction correctness and confidence, and \"self-evolution training,\" where the PLM learns from these tokens. To prevent overfitting to these challenging tokens, SE incorporates a novel Token-specific Label Smoothing (TLS) approach that adaptively regularizes training using the PLM's self-generated distributions. Experiments across 10 NLU tasks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD2.0, SWAG, and LAMA, demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements (e.g., +1.43 to +2.36 average scores) on various PLMs. Analyses confirm that SE enhances linguistic knowledge learning, model generalization, and robustness.",

Existing methods often fine-tune LLMs on entire expert trajectories, which can lead to these issues. ATLaS proposes to identify and utilize only the \"critical steps\" within expert trajectories for fine-tuning. An oracle LLM (GPT-4o) acts as a selector, categorizing critical steps into Plan Creation, Critical Observation, Critical Action, and Self Correction. By fine-tuning LLMs on a reduced set of critical steps (e.g., 30% of total tokens), ATLaS significantly cuts backpropagation costs and overfitting risks. Experiments demonstrate that ATLaS-finetuned agents achieve superior performance on both held-in and held-out tasks, outperforming baselines that fine-tune on full trajectories.

Current LLM-based code generation often relies on external retrievers for knowledge, leading to domain mismatch and finetuning issues, and frequently produces buggy code. SelfEvolve addresses these challenges by treating the LLM itself as a knowledge source, prompting it to generate multi-form necessary information based on problem intents, thereby circumventing external retrieval. Following this, it integrates an iterative self-refinement mechanism where the LLM uses an external executor (e.g., Python interpreter) to obtain feedback (pass/error messages) from authentic test cases derived from problem descriptions. This feedback guides the LLM to iteratively correct and evolve the preliminary code, mimicking human debugging. Evaluated on DS-1000, HumanEval, and TransCoder, SelfEvolve, primarily using gpt-3.5-turbo, demonstrates significant improvements over strong baselines like DocPrompting and Self-Debugging.

The approach involves two phases: Forward Reasoning, where LLMs generate multiple candidate answers using CoT and sampling, and Backward Verification. In Backward Verification, each candidate answer is used to predict a masked original condition from the problem context. A verification score is then computed based on the consistency between the predicted and actual masked values, allowing the selection of the most reliable answer.

This paper introduces CODET (CODE generation with generated Tests), a novel zero-shot method that leverages the same pre-trained LLMs to automatically generate a comprehensive set of test cases.

This synergistic approach allows the model to continuously improve its rationale generation capabilities, thereby enriching its training data. Experimental results on arithmetic, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K demonstrate that STaR significantly outperforms models fine-tuned to directly predict answers (+12.5% on CommonsenseQA) and few-shot baselines.

Existing LLM-based agents, while more flexible, still struggle with rigid planning, static beliefs, and limited persona representation, especially at city scale. CitySim introduces a scalable LLM-driven agent simulation framework designed to address these challenges. It equips agents with real-world-grounded personas (demographics, psychographics, habits), advanced memory (temporal, reflective, spatial with Kalman-filtered beliefs), dynamic needs prioritization, and Maslow's hierarchy-inspired long-term goal formation. Agents autonomously generate daily schedules through recursive, value-driven planning, select Points of Interest using a belief-aware gravity model, and choose transport modes, all powered by LLMs. A weighted social network with evolving beliefs governs agent interactions. CitySim demonstrates superior behavioral realism, accurately reproducing macro-level time-use distributions, human-like mobility patterns, and effectively predicting POI popularity and population well-being. It outperforms several strong baselines and scales efficiently to millions of agents, with ablation studies confirming the critical role of each module.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes an active inference-grounded actor-critic prompting protocol. The system features a 'Therapist agent' that generates initial responses to patient queries and a 'Supervisor agent' that refines these responses for factual accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness, leveraging a domain-specific, validated knowledge base and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A blind validation study was conducted where 100 patient queries, related to Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), were evaluated by experienced CBT-I therapists. Responses from the LLM-based Virtual Sleep Coach (VSC) were compared against appropriate and inappropriate human-crafted responses. The VSC responses consistently received high ratings, often outperforming the appropriate human responses (mean 4.327 vs 4.071 on a 1-5 Likert scale, p=7.1x10^-5), indicating effective alignment with expert standards. The study also found that longer responses tended to receive higher ratings and that a separate LLM (ChatGPT o1) could accurately distinguish between human and LLM-generated responses based on characteristics like formality and tone. This structured approach demonstrates a foundation for safely integrating advanced LLM technology into medical applications.",

This research addresses this gap by developing MetaMedQA, an enhanced benchmark derived from MedQA-USMLE, which incorporates confidence scores and specific metacognitive tasks, including questions with fictional content, malformed questions, and modified answers. The study evaluated twelve diverse LLMs on metrics such as confidence-based accuracy, missing answer recall (identifying \"None of the above\"), and unknown recall (recognizing unanswerable questions). The findings reveal significant metacognitive deficiencies across all models, with LLMs consistently failing to recognize their knowledge limitations and often providing confident answers even when no correct option was present. While GPT-4o demonstrated the best, albeit still limited, ability to vary its confidence levels, most models scored 0% on unknown recall. Prompt engineering showed some improvement for GPT-4o, but required explicit and exhaustive instructions.

    "summary": "The research addresses the critical challenge of evaluating recommender systems (RS), where offline metrics often fail to predict real-world user engagement, and online A/B testing is costly and slow. Existing LLM-based user agents for RS evaluation often lack comprehensive user personas, external knowledge integration, visual signal processing, and sophisticated decision-making mechanisms. To overcome this, the paper proposes SimUSER, a two-phase LLM-empowered agent framework. Phase 1 focuses on self-consistent persona matching, leveraging LLMs to extract detailed personas (including age, personality, occupation, pickiness, habits, and unique tastes) from historical user data. Phase 2 employs a cognitive architecture for agents, comprising persona, multimodal perception (using image-derived captions), episodic memory, and knowledge-graph memory (for user-item relationships). A 'brain' module orchestrates multi-round preference elicitation, causal action refinement, and post-interaction reflection using Chain-of-Thought prompting. Experimental results demonstrate SimUSER agents' superior performance over baselines (RecAgent, Agent4Rec) in item classification and rating prediction, exhibiting lower RMSE/MAE. Crucially, SimUSER shows higher correlation with real-world A/B test business metrics (average visited pages) and its interactions are perceived as more human-like. The framework successfully replicates psychological effects like exposure bias and the influence of visual thumbnails and reviews on user behavior, while its KG memory enhances robustness against LLM hallucination for unfamiliar items.

This paper introduces Motif, a method to bridge this gap by deriving an intrinsic reward function from a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM). Motif leverages an LLM to express preferences over pairs of high-level event captions extracted from observation datasets, distilling these preferences into a reward function that guides Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. The LLM acts as an annotator, requiring only coarse textual descriptions of events. Evaluated on the challenging NetHack Learning Environment, Motif drastically improves agent performance, even surpassing agents trained directly with extrinsic rewards in the score task and achieving significant progress in the extremely sparse oracle task without expert demonstrations. The system fosters human-aligned behaviors, generates anticipatory rewards that simplify credit assignment, and demonstrates scalability with LLM size and prompt quality. Motif also allows for steerable behavior through natural language prompts, though it reveals a 'misalignment by composition' phenomenon where combined rewards can lead to unintended, yet effective, solutions.",

Unlike prior work focusing solely on user agents or verbalizing interactions, AgentCF models both users and items as autonomous LLM-powered agents, each equipped with memory modules. The core innovation lies in a collaborative optimization framework where user and item agents autonomously interact, and a collaborative reflection mechanism enables mutual adjustment of their memories based on discrepancies with real-world interactions. This process implicitly propagates preferences, mimicking the core idea of collaborative filtering. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentCF outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in recommendation tasks, achieving comparable performance to models trained on full datasets with only a fraction of the data. Furthermore, AgentCF successfully simulates diverse human-like behaviors, including user-user interactions, item cold-start alleviation, preference propagation, and collective intelligence in advertisement creation, highlighting its potential for next-generation user behavior simulation.",

The simulator operates in a page-by-page recommendation environment with extensible collaborative filtering algorithms. Experiments demonstrate Agent4Rec's capability to accurately simulate human-like behaviors: agents consistently identify preferred items (around 65% accuracy, 75% recall), exhibit rating distributions aligned with real data, and show behaviors influenced by social traits. Agent4Rec successfully evaluates recommendation strategies, showing higher agent satisfaction with algorithmic approaches (e.g., LightGCN outperforming MF/MultVAE), replicates feedback-driven recommendation enhancement, and reveals the filter bubble effect. Furthermore, it facilitates causal discovery by inferring relationships between movie attributes, exposure, views, and ratings, highlighting the influence of quality and popularity, and the amplification of popularity bias.

    "summary": "This research reveals a critical vulnerability in medical large language models (LLMs) to targeted misinformation attacks, posing significant risks to healthcare applications. The study demonstrates a novel gradient-based method that can deliberately inject incorrect biomedical facts into LLMs by modifying as little as 1.1% of the model's weights, specifically within the multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers. The injected misinformation is shown to propagate confidently and consistently in the model's output, generalize to different contexts, and persist over time. Crucially, these attacks are stealthy, as they do not compromise the LLM's general performance, making them difficult to detect through standard metrics like perplexity. The proposed rank-one update method for weight modification significantly outperforms traditional data poisoning techniques in effectiveness, locality, and portability. Furthermore, the attacks can bypass state-of-the-art LLM safety measures, increasing jailbreaking success rates on models like Llama-3 from 2% to 58%.

Existing hierarchical planning methods, often relying on Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with the complexity, dynamic nature, and vast state space of such domains. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose \"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\" (DEPS), an interactive planning framework. DEPS employs an iterative loop where a descriptor summarizes execution failures, an LLM acts as an explainer to diagnose plan errors, and then as a planner to revise the plan. Complementing this, a learned horizon-predictive selector prioritizes sub-goals based on their estimated completion time, enhancing planning efficiency. Evaluated on 71 challenging tasks in open-world Minecraft, DEPS demonstrated superior performance, nearly doubling the overall success rate compared to baselines and achieving the long-standing \"ObtainDiamond\" task.

The solution involves players guiding an LLM-driven AI King to narrate keyword-rich tales, where specific keywords (e.g., \"sword\") spoken by the King materialize as tangible in-game items (weapons). The game dynamically generates and visualizes the story world using text-to-image models, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality. GPT-4 is employed for story evaluation and continuation, ensuring coherence and guiding player input. The results demonstrate how GenAI can be fundamental to novel game mechanics, enabling real-time multimodal content generation, enhancing player engagement through natural language input, and providing a framework for balancing player freedom with narrative integrity, thereby defining a new category of \"AI-Native games.\"",

While the LMs successfully replicated findings and even gender-sensitive effects in the first three TEs, the Wisdom of Crowds TE revealed a peculiar \"hyper-accuracy distortion\" in newer, highly-aligned models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4).

The core problem is that while LLMs can decompose high-level tasks (e.g., \"make breakfast\") into plausible mid-level plans, these plans are often not executable due to linguistic ambiguities, missing common-sense steps, or non-admissible actions specific to the environment. The proposed solution involves a procedure that semantically translates LLM-generated action phrases to admissible actions using a pre-trained masked LLM (Translation LM), employs autoregressive trajectory correction by conditioning future generation on already translated admissible actions, and utilizes dynamic example selection for improved in-context learning. Evaluated in the VirtualHome environment, the method significantly boosts executability from a naive LLM baseline of 18% to 79%.

The core of the work involves an extensive data preparation pipeline, including scraping physician opening hours from www.herold.at, cleaning and enriching this data, and then probabilistically matching it with patient contact data. This complex matching process, which combined direct assignments and an optimization-based approach, successfully integrated capacity information for 4,288 physicians, while missing data for others was imputed based on similar matched physicians. The prepared data then feeds into an agent-based model to simulate the impact of physician unavailability on system resilience, measured by indicators such as lost patients (LLP) and free capacity (LFC). The simulations revealed varying resilience levels across different medical specialities and federal states in Austria. For instance, general practitioners showed specific patterns in opening hours and patient contacts, while specialties like internal medicine and radiology demonstrated distinct vulnerabilities to physician removal. To facilitate exploration of these complex results, an interactive online visualization tool was developed, offering aggregate and detailed views of resilience indicators, physician profiles, and patient displacement networks.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the significant bottleneck in training web navigation agents: the reliance on costly, limited, and static human-annotated data. The authors propose InSTA, an automatic, three-stage pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training. The pipeline consists of an LLM-based task proposer that generates tasks across 150,000 diverse websites, an agent that executes these tasks to create trajectories, and an LLM-based judge that evaluates and filters the resulting data. This creates a scalable data flywheel that reduces dependency on human intervention. Using data from this pipeline, the researchers trained a 1.7B parameter model that achieved a 56.9% success rate, outperforming much larger frontier models like a 235B parameter Qwen model and Llama 4 Maverick. The trained agents also demonstrated strong zero-shot transferability to unseen benchmarks like WebVoyager, validating the quality and generalizability of the automatically generated data.",

The benchmark tasks are automatically constructed from recent, high-quality Kaggle notebooks to ensure realism and mitigate data contamination. Evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a critical challenge: balancing advanced reasoning with robust instruction-following.

The authors introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing authentic agent personas by integrating three core components of an individual's self-concept: Social Identity (S) from demographic data, Personal Identity (P) from psychometric scales (BFI-2-S, PVQ), and Personal Life Context (C) from short essays on preferences and daily routines. The framework's effectiveness was evaluated through both automated tests with popular drama characters and human evaluations with real-world individuals. Automated evaluations showed that the Personal Life Context (C) alone was highly effective, performing comparably to the full SPC combination for fictional characters. However, human evaluations revealed a different pattern: for real individuals, the full SPC combination provided a significantly more comprehensive and accurate self-representation than any single component, including C. This divergence highlights that while contextual narratives are powerful, a holistic integration of demographic, psychological, and contextual data is crucial for authentically simulating real-world individuals, especially those underrepresented in LLM training data.",

The authors propose the Adaptive Mode Learning (AML) framework, which equips agents with adaptive thinking capabilities. AML introduces four hierarchical thinking modes, inspired by cognitive theory, ranging from intuitive responses to deep, strategic deliberation. The training process involves an initial behavioral cloning phase to teach the model these modes, followed by reinforcement learning using a novel algorithm called Adaptive Mode Policy Optimization (AMPO). AMPO's key innovation is its advantage function, which incorporates both mode-level (comparing average reward and token length across modes) and sample-level information. This allows the agent to dynamically select the most appropriate thinking mode based on the context, balancing performance with token efficiency. Experimental results on the SOTOPIA benchmark show that AML achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by up to 15.6%, while AMPO significantly reduces token usage compared to existing RL methods.",

The authors propose an agentic workflow named 'Perceive, Reflect, and Plan' (PReP). The 'Perceive' module uses a fine-tuned LLaVA model to identify landmarks and estimate their direction and distance. The 'Reflect' module employs a memory system, inspired by human cognition, to build an internal cognitive map from historical trajectories and observations, allowing the agent to infer its position even when landmarks are not visible. Finally, the 'Plan' module uses the refined goal information to create and update a long-term navigation plan composed of sub-goals, guiding the agent's actions. Experiments conducted on newly created datasets for four cities (Beijing, Shanghai, New York, Paris) show that the PReP agent significantly outperforms baselines like React and RL methods, achieving an average success rate of 54%. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed workflow and highlight the crucial roles of both reflection and planning in enabling complex spatial reasoning for LLM agents.",

The authors propose a two-pronged strategy to enhance the capabilities of these low-parameter models. The first approach involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using a custom-built dataset. This dataset is generated by leveraging GPT-4 to simulate multi-role interactions (e.g., question generator, action maker, environment) to create rich, multi-turn conversational data reflecting agent thought processes and actions. This agent-specific data is mixed with general instruction data to preserve the model's broad knowledge. The second approach, termed multi-branch reasoning, improves inference-time performance without further model changes. It combines task decomposition, which breaks down complex goals into simpler sub-tasks, with backtracking, a multi-path reasoning mechanism that allows the agent to explore alternative solutions when a path proves suboptimal. Experiments conducted on the AgentBench benchmark demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the performance of 7B and 13B models, reducing common issues like hallucinations and enhancing success rates on complex agent tasks.",

    "summary": "This paper identifies two key gaps in evaluating LLM-based generative agents: the lack of a standardized interface for connecting diverse agent architectures to various benchmarks, and the over-reliance on binary success/fail metrics which offer limited insight for debugging. To address this, the authors introduce AgentQuest, a modular benchmark framework that provides a unified driver to streamline agent-environment integration. More critically, AgentQuest proposes two new metrics: Progress Rate, which tracks an agent's advancement towards a solution by measuring reached milestones, and Repetition Rate, which quantifies the agent's tendency to repeat similar actions. The authors demonstrate the framework's utility across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, Lateral Thinking Puzzles, and the newly introduced Mastermind and Sudoku). By analyzing the interplay of these new metrics, they show how to diagnose specific failure modes. For instance, in the Mastermind benchmark, high repetition and stalled progress led to an architectural improvement (adding a memory buffer) that increased the success rate by approximately 20%. This work provides a practical tool for researchers to not only measure but also understand and improve agent performance.",

The environment is fully self-hosted and reproducible, integrating open-source tools like GitLab, OwnCloud, and RocketChat, and uniquely features LLM-powered simulated colleagues to test interaction. The evaluation is granular, using a checkpoint system to award partial credit for long-horizon tasks. Experiments with twelve prominent LLMs, using the OpenHands agent framework, reveal that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, only achieves a 30.3% full completion rate. The results show that agents struggle significantly with tasks requiring social interaction and navigation of complex user interfaces, even more so than with technical coding tasks. This suggests that while agents show promise, they are far from automating the full spectrum of workplace activities, highlighting key areas for future development.",

The authors identify three key issues with current agent fine-tuning: 1) training data entangles format-following with reasoning, deviating from the model's pre-trained conversational domain; 2) models learn different agent-related capabilities at varying speeds; and 3) existing methods often introduce or worsen hallucination problems. To solve this, they propose Agent-FLAN, a fine-tuning methodology that redesigns the training process. Agent-FLAN aligns agent data with a natural chat format to decouple format from reasoning, decomposes tasks into fundamental capabilities (e.g., reasoning, retrieval) to allow for balanced data mixing based on learning difficulty, and introduces negative sample learning to mitigate hallucinations. The authors also create the Agent-H benchmark to specifically evaluate agent hallucinations. Applied to the Llama2-7B model, Agent-FLAN outperforms previous best methods by 3.5% on average across several agent evaluation benchmarks and significantly reduces hallucinations, while also showing positive scaling with model size.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, adopting a life-cycle assessment (LCA) perspective. The authors aim to quantify emissions beyond the typical scope of dynamic power consumption during training. They meticulously calculate the contributions from three key areas: embodied emissions from manufacturing the server and GPU hardware, dynamic power consumption from the active training process, and idle power consumption from the supporting infrastructure. The study finds that BLOOM's final training emitted 50.5 tonnes of CO2eq in total, with dynamic consumption accounting for less than half of this figure (24.7 tonnes). Embodied emissions and idle consumption represent 22.2% and 28.9% of the total, respectively, highlighting their significance. Furthermore, the paper includes an empirical study on the energy cost of deploying BLOOM for inference, revealing a substantial continuous power draw even with low request volumes. The authors conclude by comparing BLOOM's footprint to other large models, emphasizing the critical impact of low-carbon energy grids, and advocating for more granular and transparent reporting standards in the ML community.",

The authors address the problem that state-of-the-art LLMs were often proprietary and prohibitively large, hindering broader research. Their solution was to train smaller models on a massive amount of data (trillions of tokens) sourced exclusively from publicly available datasets. This approach prioritizes inference efficiency, arguing that a smaller model trained for longer is more economical to deploy at scale than a larger, faster-to-train model. The results demonstrate the success of this strategy: LLaMA-13B outperforms the much larger GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with leading models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.

The authors evaluated PALMS on GPT-3 models of various sizes against baseline and control models. The results demonstrate that PALMS-tuned models perform significantly better across multiple metrics: they achieve lower toxicity scores, receive higher human evaluation ratings for adherence to the target values, and exhibit more neutral word associations for social categories like race, gender, and religion. Notably, the effectiveness of the process increases with model size, and it achieves these behavioral changes with a surprisingly small dataset (80 examples) without significantly compromising the model's general capabilities.",

By masking irrelevant regions, RTBAS prevents unnecessary propagation of malicious (low-integrity) or confidential data, a problem known as label creep.

The study conducts extensive experiments across various frameworks (AutoGen, Camel), communication structures (Chain, Tree, Complete, Random), and real-world applications (MetaGPT, ChatDev). The results demonstrate that AiTM achieves high attack success rates, often exceeding 70%, revealing that communication mechanisms are a significant weak point in current LLM-MAS architectures.

The authors argue that this memory, often containing sensitive information, is a significant and underexplored attack surface. To demonstrate this vulnerability, they propose the Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA), a black-box attack method. MEXTRA features a novel two-part prompt design that first locates the desired private data within the agent's context and then aligns the output format with the agent's specific workflow, enabling extraction even from non-textual agents (e.g., web or code-powered agents). The paper also introduces an automated method to generate diverse attacking prompts tailored to different levels of attacker knowledge. Through empirical evaluation on healthcare and online shopping agents, the study shows that MEXTRA can effectively extract a substantial number of private user queries.

Corba operates by injecting a malicious prompt into a single agent, which then enters an infinite recursive blocking state.

The authors argue that existing jailbreak methods for single LLMs are insufficient for complex agentic systems due to factors like agent quantity, role definitions, and interaction environments. To analyze these risks, they first use a template-based attack to show that attack success rates increase with the number of agents. The core contribution is \"Evil Geniuses\" (EG), a novel multi-agent framework designed to autonomously generate sophisticated, role-specific jailbreak prompts. EG employs a Red-Blue team structure—comprising a Harmful Prompt Writer, a Suitability Reviewer, and a Toxicity Tester—to refine attacks for both system-level and agent-level targets. Evaluations on agent frameworks like CAMEL, MetaGPT, and ChatDev, using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, demonstrate high attack success rates.

To implement this, they developed \"Task Shield,\" a test-time defense mechanism that acts as a guardian for the LLM agent. Task Shield continuously monitors the conversation, extracts all actionable instructions from the user, assistant, and external tools, and uses an LLM to verify that each new instruction contributes to the user's stated goals.

Through extensive experiments on the AgentDoJo benchmark with models like GPT-4o, Task Shield demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing attack success rates to as low as 2.07% while maintaining high task completion utility, thus achieving a superior security-utility trade-off compared to existing defense methods.",

The authors demonstrate that an adversary can compromise an entire network of millions of agents exponentially fast by initially infecting just a single agent.

When an infected agent communicates, it is induced to share the adversarial image from its memory album, which is then stored by the receiving agent, thereby propagating the infection. The paper formalizes these infectious dynamics using a mathematical model analogous to epidemiological models, deriving a condition (β > 2γ, where β is infection rate and γ is recovery rate) under which the infection's spread is unstoppable. Through large-scale simulations with up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, the study empirically validates the theoretical model, showing that a single infected agent can lead to system-wide compromise in a logarithmic number of interaction rounds, a significant threat to the large-scale deployment of MLLM agents.",

The FITD attack involves presenting the agent with a small, harmless request (a 'distractor') immediately before a malicious one. This exploits the agent's procedural nature, as the paper hypothesizes that ReAct agents primarily perform safety checks during the 'thought' generation phase and are less likely to re-evaluate actions once they are part of the plan. Experimental results demonstrate that FITD increases the attack success rate by up to 44.8% across various models. To address this vulnerability, the authors propose and evaluate three reflection-based defense mechanisms of varying intrusiveness: self-reflection, a hesitation reflector, and a general safety agent.

The authors introduce the concept of an \"Agent Constitution,\" a set of safety principles focused on actions and tool use, distinct from existing AI constitutions that target verbal harm.

This includes a (1) pre-planning strategy to instill safety knowledge via regulation and hindsight learning, (2) an in-planning strategy that uses dynamically retrieved regulations to guide plan generation in real-time, and (3) a post-planning strategy where a safety inspector agent reviews and revises the generated plan before execution. Experiments across five domains (housekeeping, finance, medicine, chemistry, food) with multiple LLMs demonstrate that TrustAgent significantly improves both the safety and helpfulness of agent-generated plans.

The paper categorizes architectures into single-agent and multi-agent systems, further dividing the latter into vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (collaborative) structures. It examines specific frameworks like ReAct, Reflexion, and LATS for single-agent patterns, and AgentVerse, MetaGPT, and DyLAN for multi-agent patterns, highlighting their distinct approaches to problem-solving. The authors find that while single-agent systems are effective for well-defined tasks, multi-agent systems excel in scenarios requiring collaboration, parallelization, and diverse feedback. The paper concludes that successful agent design, regardless of architecture, relies on key principles such as clear role definition, iterative feedback loops, dedicated planning phases, and structured communication. It also identifies significant challenges in the field, particularly the lack of standardized benchmarks, issues with reliability, and the inheritance of biases from underlying language models.",

The authors address the problem that while LLM agents offer immense potential, their complex, interactive nature introduces novel vulnerabilities beyond those of static LLMs. The paper systematically categorizes threats into two main groups: inherited threats from underlying LLMs (e.g., hallucinations, jailbreaking, data extraction) and unique, agent-specific threats that target the agent's workflow (knowledge poisoning, functional manipulation, and output manipulation). To illustrate these risks, the paper utilizes a running case study of a virtual town populated by LLM agents, demonstrating the real-world impact of attacks on users, the environment, and inter-agent communication. The survey also reviews existing mitigation strategies for each threat category and concludes by discussing future trends and challenges, particularly the security implications of emerging Multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents and LLM Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems, thereby providing a foundational guide for researchers and developers.",

The core problem is that advanced tool-use capabilities are typically confined to large, proprietary models like GPT-4, which are inaccessible and computationally expensive. The proposed solution is a self-instruction pipeline where a powerful 'teacher' model (GPT-3.5) is prompted with multi-modal context (image captions, object locations) and tool definitions to generate a large-scale, instruction-following dataset. This dataset is augmented with negative samples (deciding not to use a tool) and contextual samples (multi-step interactions) to improve robustness. Open-source LLMs are then efficiently fine-tuned on this dataset using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experiments show that this method significantly improves the models' ability to use seen tools (e.g., Vicuna-13B's success rate jumps from 12.4% to 94.1%) and, crucially, enables them to generalize and use unseen tools with performance comparable to GPT-3.5.",

Existing methods for integrating external tools can disrupt the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process. This paper introduces ChatCoT, a tool-augmented reasoning framework that models the entire process as a multi-turn conversation with a chat-based LLM. Instead of a single, continuous generation, ChatCoT breaks down reasoning into a series of conversational turns.

This iterative, conversational approach allows for a more natural and flexible integration of tool use without interrupting the logical flow.

The authors address the limitation of conventional LFQA systems that use static, non-interactive retrieval. They developed a web interface to record human annotators' real-time search behaviors, including issuing queries, browsing pages, and extracting supporting facts. This process yielded a dataset of 5,500 high-quality question-answer pairs, along with over 125,000 recorded web search actions. The authors propose a modular framework consisting of a 'search model' and a 'synthesis model'. The search model, trained via behavioral cloning on fine-tuned language models, imitates human actions for information retrieval. The synthesis model then generates a coherent, paragraph-length answer from the collected facts. Experiments show that a pipeline using a 10B parameter model generates answers that are comparable to or better than human-written ones 32.5% of the time on their dataset and demonstrates strong out-of-distribution generalization on the DuReader dataset.",

Second, using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique (LoRA) to adapt a pre-trained code model (like CodeGen) to this new dataset, enabling it to learn when and how to call a search tool. Third, integrating this tool-use capability into the decoding process, allowing the model to autonomously query a search tool (either an online engine for public libraries or a documentation-based retriever for private ones) and use the results to generate more accurate code.

Once a toolken is generated, the model enters a special \"tool mode\" to generate the required arguments, guided by specific in-context examples for that tool.

The core problem addressed is that LLMs often fail at tasks requiring both precise calculations and specialized domain knowledge, as they are prone to arithmetic errors and have limited, static knowledge. The proposed solution uses few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to teach GPT-3 how to generate reasoning steps that include special 'tool triggers.' When a trigger is detected, the system executes the corresponding external tool (e.g., a calculator, a chemical reaction predictor, a molar mass list) and injects the result back into the reasoning chain for the LLM to continue.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of modeling agent heterogeneity and long-term dynamics in traditional agent-based models (ABM) for macroeconomics. The authors introduce EconAgent, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent designed for simulating economic activities. The framework consists of a simulation environment with labor, consumption, and financial markets, and agents that make work and consumption decisions. Each EconAgent is endowed with a unique profile (age, job) through a perception module to foster heterogeneity. A memory module allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market trends, influencing their sequential decisions. Experimental results show that simulations using EconAgent produce more stable and realistic macroeconomic phenomena, such as inflation and unemployment rates, compared to rule-based and reinforcement learning-based agents. Furthermore, the EconAgent framework successfully reproduces classic economic regularities like the Phillips Curve and Okun's Law, demonstrating its ability to capture complex, human-like economic behavior.",

The paper proposes TRICE (Tool-leaRning wIth exeCution fEedback), a two-stage training framework designed to teach LLMs when and how to use tools effectively. The first stage, Behavior Cloning, involves supervised fine-tuning to make the model imitate tool-invoking behavior.

This stage uses a ranking loss to align the model's outputs with more desirable responses, encouraging selective tool use. Experimental results across eight benchmark datasets and various models (ChatGLM, Alpaca, Vicuna) demonstrate that TRICE significantly improves performance over standard fine-tuning and prompting methods.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of early and accurate diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms. The authors propose SARA, an LLM-based agentic framework designed for RA screening. To ground the system in real-world clinical data, they introduce PreRAID, a new dataset of 160 consented patients. SARA employs a multi-stage reasoning process by decomposing the diagnostic task among different agent configurations: a single agent (Solo), a two-agent pipeline (Duo), and a three-agent pipeline (Trio). These agents leverage the PreRAID dataset as a knowledge base to analyze patient symptoms and generate a diagnosis with human-readable explanations. Through extensive experiments, the Duo agent configuration achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy of 95%, outperforming both simpler and more complex setups.

The authors propose the Interactive Graph Discovery Agent (IGDA), an LLM-based pipeline that leverages semantic metadata about variables rather than numerical data. IGDA operates in two key phases: first, it selects edges for experimentation by prioritizing those with the highest uncertainty, as estimated by the LLM's confidence in its own predictions. Second, after receiving binary feedback from an experiment on a specific edge, the LLM performs local updates, revising its predictions and confidence scores for neighboring, un-tested edges. Experiments conducted on eight real-world graphs demonstrate that IGDA frequently outperforms baselines like random selection and a state-of-the-art numerical method. Ablation studies confirm that both the uncertainty-driven selection and the local update strategy are crucial for its success.

    "summary": "This paper introduces MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The core problem addressed is that single-pass LLMs struggle with complex, multi-step tasks that require exploration and self-correction. MALT decomposes the reasoning process into a sequential pipeline of three specialized agents: a Generator, a Verifier, and a Refiner. To train these agents without human supervision, the method first generates a large search tree of reasoning trajectories by sampling from each agent. It then uses a value iteration technique to propagate a binary reward signal (based on the final answer's correctness) backward through the tree, automatically assigning credit or blame to each intermediate step. This creates a large-scale dataset of positive and negative examples for each agent's role, which is then used for post-training via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experiments on MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA show that MALT significantly outperforms the baseline LLM and other fine-tuning approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of training specialized agents for collaborative problem-solving.",

      "The data generation process, which creates n^3 trajectories per question, is computationally expensive and may be difficult to scale.",
      "The methodology is presented as an offline post-training process, which may not be suitable for online learning or continuous adaptation without re-running the entire pipeline.",
      "The credit assignment process relies on the existence of a ground-truth training set to provide the final reward signal, limiting its use for tasks without objective answers.",
      "The paper evaluates on subsets of the test sets due to computational constraints, which may slightly limit the generalizability of the reported results.",
      "The architecture is fixed to a specific three-agent sequential pipeline; the optimality of this structure over other possible multi-agent configurations is not explored."
